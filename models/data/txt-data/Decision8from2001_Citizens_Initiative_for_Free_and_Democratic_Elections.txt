Dear Constitutional Judges,

The Gisdi Association considers the request to declare
unconstitutionality of the provision of art. 7, para 2 proposal second and
Article 76 of the Law on Election of Members of Parliament as justified.
The challenged provisions contradict Art. 6, para 2 and art. 10 from
The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. Our motives are the following:

1. The provisions adopted shall, in substance, establish a property qualification for
participation in the elections for the parties, coalitions and independent candidates, p
which violates passive suffrage, especially with regard to
independent candidates and small parties. To raise money for
ballot printing parties will have two possible options:

A) to tax their members with additional membership fees, which
means the introduction of "tax newsletters" and automatically means that part of
voters will actually pay for the right to vote
unequal as the amount for each party or coalition participating in
The elections will be the same, but for small parties and coalitions this price will increase
distributes to fewer voters and respectively to the individual voter
becomes times higher.

or

B) to accept "donations" from sponsors, which automatically puts them in
the position to depend on them in their eventual entry into power and
leads to the promotion of "clientelism" among players in political life
in the country.

The adopted provisions put the parties with
large membership and small parties, as well as the parties in power and those in
opposition. The amount that each party must pay - large or
small, in power or in opposition is the same, which immediately puts
the ability of parties to participate in elections depending on theirs
financial resources. On this basis, privileges are created for the big ones
players in the political life of the country, as only they will be able to
pay the required amount relatively easily. Although at the beginning of
the election race will have a large number of registered to participate in
elections parties and coalitions, their actual number will be reduced
significantly after 31 days before the election, the CEC canceled the registration of
parties that did not pay for the printing of their ballots. Violates
the principle of equality before the law, in this case the lack of
finance is an obstacle to the free formation of political will
of the citizens of the Republic of Bulgaria.

Particularly unsuccessful is articulated art. 76 para
production of the ballots are announced by the Council of Ministers ... ”. This suggests one thing
non-market formation of the price of the ballots and may create conditions
for a kind of racketeering by the executive. It is not recorded that
the printing of the ballots is the subject of a public procurement. Its possible
to form an arbitrarily high price of ballots, which will refuse
many of the participants in the political process and will create conditions for
corruption not only at the personal level, but rather at the leadership level of
the ruling party with the subsequent inclusion of these funds in

the election campaign.
