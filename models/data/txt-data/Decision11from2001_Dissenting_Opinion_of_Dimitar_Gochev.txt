Special opinion of Judge Dimitar Gochev I have signed the decision of the Constitutional Court on the said case with a special opinion on the unconstitutionality of Article 101, paragraph 1 of the Medical Establishments Act. assistance in sole proprietorships can no doubt be done by an act of the Minister when the hospital was state-owned. However, when the hospital is municipal property, the Minister's order would be a disposition of municipal property - something that would be a violation and encroachment. of the right to municipal property and this undoubtedly for me constitutes a violation of Article 17 para. 1 of the Constitution.
