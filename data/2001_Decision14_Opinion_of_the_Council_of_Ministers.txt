OPINION
from
The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria
on

constitutional case Mo 7 for 2001

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,
DEAR MADAMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES,

By order of March 29, 2001, we were constituted as
interested party in the constitutional case Me 7 for 2001, initiated
at the request of 54 MPs from the 38th National Assembly for
establishing entirely the> unconstitutionality of the Law on
amendment of the Law on Access to the Documents of the Former
State Security (AIS ZDDBDS), promulgated in the State Gazette, issue
24 of 2001, or alternatively> to establish
the unconstitutionality of 8 6, 8 7 his part, with which art.
Agichl. 4e, 83, 85, 88, 821, 823 and 25 of the law.

1. Regarding the allegations of contradiction of the Amendments and Supplements to the VAT Act with Article
4, para. 1, art. 87, para. Tichl. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution

The request alleges that the AIS ZDDBDS contradicts Art. 4, para. That
The Constitution, as its adoption violated Art. 11, para. 1 of
The Law on Normative Acts (LNA) and Art. 68 Art. 69, para. 2 of the Regulations
for the organization and activity of the National Assembly (PODNS).

The violation of Art. 11, para. 1 of the LNA is justified by the fact that
The Law on Access to Documents of the Former State Security
(ZDDBDS), which is amended and supplemented, had 14 members located on 3
pages, while the draft of the National Assembly, originally submitted to the National Assembly
ZID ZDDBDS had 22 paragraphs, located on 7 pages, and the adopted one
was three times larger in volume than originally imported and was
located on 17 pages.

The violation of PODNS is justified by the fact that between the first and
second reading and after the deadlines for proposals was tabled
practically a new bill, which in principle differed from the adopted one
at the first vote and was “made by someone unknown and imported by someone unknown
whom ”. The fact that the bill was new was evident from its new title.

The Council of Ministers is not the submitter of the draft of the Law on Public Procurement Act,
therefore we do not have accurate information about the content
of the bill originally submitted to the National Assembly and
the amendments made between the first and second votes in
him. However, we believe that the above arguments of the group of people
representatives can not substantiate the conclusion of unconstitutionality of
of the law.

Possible violations in the legislative process could
lead to unconstitutionality of the law only if they are violations
of constitutional norms establishing requirements for the manner of
adoption of laws. When the law is passed in compliance with
the requirements of art. 87 Art. 88 of the Constitution, it cannot be argued that
violation or non - compliance with other procedural rules under
the adoption of the normative acts, established in LNA and PODNS, leads to
unconstitutional, as it was a violation of the principle of
the rule of law established in Art. 4, para. 1. The purpose of the LNA is to create
rules for the drafting of regulations relevant to
the application and interpretation of the acts. Article 11, para. 1 of the LNA is legal, and

non-constitutional norm and non-compliance with this text in the adoption of

a law cannot be a ground for unconstitutionality of the law.
Perceiving the opposite would mean that any special law would
was unconstitutional as adopted in violation of the constitutional
principle of the rule of law, as it establishes deviations
of the general order established by an effective law.

A conclusion in a similar sense follows from the reasons in Decision Me 5 of
1998 on constitutional case Co 2 for 1998, in which the Constitutional
the court held that:

“The assessment of constitutionality ... according to Art. 149, para. 1,
item 2 of the Constitution can be given only in view of this,
whether constitutional provisions and not other normative ones have been violated
acts introducing additional requirements and procedures (Decision Mo 3
since 1991 under k. e. Me 17 of 1991)

The provisions in PODNS do not have the rank of a constitutional norm and
their violation also cannot justify the unconstitutionality of
of the law. In this sense is the permanent practice of the Constitutional Court. IN
Judgment Me 3 of the Constitutional Court of 1992 in constitutional case Co
30 for 1991 states:

“Failure to comply with the rules of procedure of the> Rules of Procedure
the organization and activity of the National Assembly is not a violation of
constitutional norms. "The Constitutional Court does not discuss such
violations ”.

The opinion of the Constitutional Court is similar in its others
solutions. According to Decision Ke 3 of 1995 on constitutional case Mo 6 for
1995 the fact that Art. 73 of the Constitution explicitly provides
the establishment of PODNS does not attach to the regulations constitutional
nature and its provisions do not become and are not constitutional norms. IN
the same decision the Constitutional Court stated that it did not find grounds
to abandon his understanding expressed in constitutional case Mo 17 of
1991, and after the provisions of PODNS do not represent
constitutional "norms", then their violation does not lead to

unconstitutionality. For these reasons, the Constitutional Court is
held that the alleged violations of the PODNS in the request were irrelevant to
resolving the case and did not discuss in its decision whether these rules were
were violated. The same opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court and in
Decision Ke 7 of 1998 on constitutional case Me 5 for 1998 and in Decision
Ke 1 of 1999 in constitutional case Me 34 for 1998.

If, nevertheless, the Constitutional Court considers that it should
discusses the allegations of the MPs for admitted
violations of LNA and PODNS, we believe that they are unfounded. Article 11, para.
1 of the LNA stipulates that repeal of a law and its replacement with a new one is allowed
only when the changes are numerous and substantial. The purpose of is clear
the legal text and the introduction of the two cumulative requirements - to
limit the cases of repeal of an existing law and its replacement with a new one,
except when it is necessary to emphasize the essential difference between
both systems. It is not clear from the request why the MPs
consider that the changes are not only numerous but also significant as
they indicate only quantitative arguments for the number of paragraphs and pages,
on which the Law on Personal Income Tax is located. Indeed, the law contains
numerous changes, but it does not rearrange in a new, fundamentally different way
way matter. It creates a more detailed arrangement in line with the reasons
of Decision Mo 10 of the Constitutional Court of 1997 on constitutional
Case No 14 of 1997 concerning the authorities carrying out the inspection under
the law, the place of the Constitutional Court and the president in the system of
state bodies, the obligation of the state to legally guarantee
the dignity and rights of the individual, while ensuring the right
of public information. The VAT Act does not change the purpose or
the subject of the law, which is amended and supplemented, which means that there is not
grounds for adoption of a new law.

The allegations of violations of Art. 68 and
Art. 69, para. 2 of PODNS. The law, whether it amends or supplements
another law or creates a primary regulation of public relations is one thing

as a whole, bound by a common goal and principles. The adoption of the law in two
voting gives the opportunity to cover all the relationships that
should be settled by it. That is why the Constitution does not restrict
the legislator 's ability to supplement or amend the drafts of the
laws between the two votes. In accordance with it, Art. 68, para. 1 of
PODNS explicitly allows not only amendments but also additions to the adopted of
first vote bill, and Art. 69, para. 3 of PODNS puts
restrictions only on the discussion and voting of proposals which
contradict the principles of the bill passed at first vote,
but not for proposals that complement the bill without
contradict its principles. The request does not indicate which of
the principles in the bill passed at the first vote contradict
the texts supplemented and amended in the second ballot, which would be
necessary to substantiate the allegations of the MPs
for contradiction with art. 69, para. 2 of PODNS.

According to the group of MPs between the first and second
voting in the committee of the National Assembly was introduced practically new
a bill that was "apocryphal" and "mysterious" because they were not in it
neither names nor signatures were noted. That meant the law
was adopted by a single vote and was not submitted by MPs
or by the Council of Ministers, i.e. in violation of Art. 87, para. 1 art. 88, para. 1
of the Constitution.

The draft of the Law on Public Procurement Act was submitted by MPs to
compliance with Art. 87, para. 1 was adopted by two votes in accordance with
Art. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution. This is not denied by the group of people
representatives, as in the request they indicate the incoming number of
bill and describe the actions taken between the two votes in
National Assembly. Therefore, the constitutional requirements of Art.
87, para. Tichl. 88, para. 1 are observed. The request does not indicate why the people
Representatives believe that the bill passed in the second vote is

"Fundamentally different from the one adopted at the first vote", as principled

a difference between two bills cannot be justified solely by
the volume of the bill, with the number of paragraphs in it and with the number of
the pages on which it is located. The content requirements of
the bills and the assumptions of the MPs, to
the deadlines for submission and the manner of their certification, which are
established in PODNS, in acts of the Speaker of the National Assembly
or in the practical work of parliament and its committees, cannot
justify a violation of Art. 87, para. 1 art. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution.

In this sense is the Decision Me 1 of the Constitutional Court of 1999.
in Constitutional Case 34 for 1998, which states:

"The law ... was passed in two separate votes
meetings, which is in full compliance with the requirements of Art. 88, para. 1.
Assoc. first of the Constitution. "Possible violation of procedural
rules not provided for in the Constitution, but in the PODNS, do not lead to its
violation. The fact that PODNS itself is subject to control for
constitutionality, shows that its non-observance cannot be
equated with a violation of the Constitution. ”

2. Regarding the allegations of contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art. 8,
Art. 117 et seq., Art. 153 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, Art. 4 in its wording after
the amendment with 8 6 of the Amendments to the VAT Act and Art. 4a, established by 8 7 of the Amendments to the VAT Act,
which provides for the establishment of a commission of 7 members, 5 of whom are elected
from the National Assembly, and 2 - from the Council of Ministers, were
unconstitutional, as the majority in the National Assembly
would appoint 5 members, and the Council of Ministers, which was elected by
this majority would appoint the other two members. That meant that
this commission will not be an impartial body, but it will be
political body.

The request does not indicate which constitutional text or principle
the disputed texts contradict. Nevertheless, we do not find

contradiction between these texts and the Constitution as they are

compliant on the one hand with the constitutional principle of division of
the authorities, on the other hand, take into account the interests of all political forces,
represented in parliament. According to Art. 4a, para. 1, item 1 of the Access Act
to the documents of the former State Security and the former Intelligence
management of the General Staff members of the commission from the quota of
The National Assembly is elected on the proposal of various
parliamentary groups. Therefore, the representatives of the parliamentary
opposition will have the same rights and the same access to information as well
representatives of the parliamentary majority and the government. From
on the other hand, the decision to disclose the information is
assigned to a committee set up in such a way as to exclude the participation of
the legislature and the Council of Ministers. The method of compiling
the commission, as well as the overall regulation in the law, create enough
guarantees for the realization of the purposes of the law under the conditions of
equality and objectivity.

The request also claims that 8 7 in its part, which creates Art.
4d, contradicts Art. 8, Art. 117 et seq. And Art. 153 of the Constitution.
The commission under art. 4d, whose members are appointed by the President,
the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Attorney General would
be a "covert" political body carrying out political orders ",
because the president was the representative of the majority and the president
of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General were appointed by him.

We will not comment on the allegations in the request for so-called “explainable
bias ”of the President, the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and
the Attorney General, as we believe that such qualifications are
inadmissible, especially within the framework of the Constitution
procedure for challenging the constitutionality of a law.

According to Art. 92, para. Tichl. 93, para. 1 of the Constitution the President
embodies the unity of the nation and is elected directly by the electorate.
The President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General

appointed by the President on the proposal of the Supreme Judicial Council at

the conditions of art. 129, para. 2 of the Constitution. The conditions for her election
the release of these bodies ensures their independence and
exclude the possibility of political pressure on them
or influence. It is the way of forming this commission that will
makes the final decision to disclose the information, creates
guarantee its objectivity and impartiality and exclude
the possibility of it being a political body.

The allegations that 8 7 in the part with which it is
creates art. 4d, contradicts the constitutional principle of division of
authorities, of Art. 117 et seq. And of Art. 153 of the Constitution, as he assigned
of the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General
powers they did not have, which in turn meant an amendment and
addition to the Constitution in contradiction with Art. 153. There is no violation
of Art. 8 of the Constitution and the principle of separation of powers, as
as the law does not seize or shift constitutional functions between
individual authorities.

The Constitutional Court has had occasion to rule in connection with
the separation of powers and the interaction between them. In Decision Mo 6
of the Constitutional Court of 1993 in constitutional case Ho 4 of 1993,
is called:

"The legal and political content of the term" division of
authorities ”consists in the fact that the state power has three main spheres of
manifestation assigned to three main systems of organs that are
relatively independent of each other and function in a certain
mutual connection. We are talking about the three main functions of the state
power, i.e. distinguishing competence between the three groups of bodies, not
some kind of triumph excluded from the rule of the modern state.
.... The scientific explanation requires that account be taken of the fact that there is none
The "Great Wall of China" between the various authorities, that they interact with each other
and that in the end they are manifestations of the unified state power and

sovereignty. This is the idea embedded in Art. 8 of the Constitution ...

Moreover, the commission under Art. 4d is not a court panel and it does not
powers of a judicial authority. This is clear from its powers,
specified in the law. The statement in the request that the authorities of
the judiciary appoints from its system other bodies of
the executive branch - the chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation and
the Attorney General does not appoint the commission as a collegial body of
executive power, and nominate individual members. Permanently
established practice in the operation of the 1991 Constitution is
the appointment of magistrates in the central election commissions for
holding parliamentary and presidential elections, as well as
the appointment in these cases is made by non-judicial bodies
power such as the President and the National Assembly. The perception of
the claim of MPs that the participation of magistrates in
bodies outside the judiciary are unconstitutional
meant that the elections in which magistrates participated in
election commissions were produced in violation of the Constitution.
On the contrary, the participation of magistrates in the commission and a representative of
the President, as well as the conditions for the appointment and dismissal of
the members of the commission shall establish guarantees of its impartiality,
objectivity and independence.

The Constitution does not exhaustively regulate the powers of the chief
prosecutor and the chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation. Article 133 of
The Constitution refers to a law on organization and structure
of the judiciary, which also regulates the powers of
the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General. If
accept that the conferral of powers by law on the President of
The Supreme Court of Cassation and the "Chief Prosecutor" is
unconstitutional, this would mean that the texts in the Act on
the judiciary and in procedural laws in their part concerning
the powers of these bodies are unconstitutional because

supplement and amend the Constitution.

The request also disputes 8 7 in the part with which Art. 4d,
arguing that the text which provides for the establishment of working groups by
executive authorities has been unconstitutional since
the ministers and the other heads of the bodies under art. 4d bili
representatives of the ruling political formation and those appointed by
their primary commissions would carry out party orders.

We believe that the law contains sufficient guarantees of objectivity
and the impartiality of the law enforcement authorities. Does not respond
to the truth the statement that the working groups would make subjective
judgment. The working groups do only preparatory work, but they do not
decide to disclose the information. Moreover, the law does not
allows subjective judgment, as it exhaustively states
what documents should be available to make one or the other
conclusion regarding the activity of the person - art. 5, para. 2 in its wording after
the amendment with 8 8 of the Amendments to the VAT Act. Decisions are made by
the commission under art. 4d, the method of compiling which guarantees
its objectivity and impartiality, and every citizen has the right to
judicial protection against wrongful acts committed in violation of
of the law - art. bg, created with 8 11 of the AIS ZDDBDS.

3. Regarding the allegations for contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art.
4, para. 2, Art. 32, para. 2, Art. 38 and Art. 56 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, the law contradicts
the constitutional texts mentioned and the principles in the preamble of
The Constitution that the basic law protects the citizen from discrediting, from
damage to his good name, honor and dignity.

The issue of the compliance of the VAT Act with the constitutional one
the guaranteed right of citizens to information and constitutionally
the established obligation of the state to defend citizens from
discrediting and damaging their good name, honor and dignity, is
clarified in detail in the reasons of Decision Me 10 of the Constitutional Court of

1997 in constitutional case Mo 14 for 1997. In the case it was also

a request was made to declare the unconstitutionality entirely on
VATA, which was rejected by the Constitutional Court. In the reasons of
the decision states that the right of society to receive
information “that> is of interest to him is essential
constitutional right enshrined in Art. 41, para. 1 of the Constitution. When
legislation on the right to information, as is the case with
VATA, the state is obliged to comply with the restrictions specified in
this constitutional text and to provide legal guarantees for the protection of
listed in Art. 41, para 1 of the Constitution constitutional values ​​and
fundamental rights - the rights and reputation of citizens, the national
security, public order, public health and morality.

We believe that the AIS of the VAT Act is fully compliant with the motives in
the said decision of the Constitutional Court. The law regulates in detail
the conditions and the order for disclosure of information and the right to judicial
protection of citizens and does not link the disclosed information to any
either negative consequences or restriction of the rights of individuals,
whose names are disclosed in the prescribed order. The statement in
the demand that the law create conditions for the persecution of citizens
due to their beliefs in contradiction with Art. 38 of the Constitution. One
of the merits of the law is that it does not contain an evaluative moment and does not
imposes on> legislative order a certain moral conclusion, such as
at the same time, it provides for the disclosure of sufficient data to enable it to do so
every citizen to judge from the point of view of his own morality and
views in each case whether the activity was
worthy of respect or has been reprehensible. Therefore it cannot be
argues that the law infringes on the dignity and rights of the individual and
violates Art. 4, para. 2 and Art. 38 of the Constitution. On the contrary, he only
provides an opportunity for citizens to receive the same form and
content information. The dignity and good name of the citizens
could only be harmed if they were dealing with

anti-social and reprehensible activity, which is why they do not want to

society to know about it. We believe that in this case not the law, but
their conscious activity has damaged their dignity and reputation,
and that in comparing their interest with the law of society
of information should undoubtedly be given priority to the right of
information society.

The allegations of contradiction with Art. 32, para. 2 of the Constitution are
incompatible with the law - on the one hand this constitutional text
allows exceptions provided by law, and on the other hand, the Law on Personal Income Tax does not
provides for tracking, photographing, filming, recording of persons,
whose names will be disclosed under the conditions and in the manner provided therein.

The request alleges that the notion of "beneficiaries"
used in 6 7, 8 8, 8 21 and others. it was so "stretchy" that it gave
opportunity for subjective judgment and for discrediting the persons
judgment. We do not share this statement with MPs, no
only in so far as it concerns the defamation for the reasons already mentioned,
and his share of subjective judgment. In Art. 5, para. 3 of the Access Act
to the documents of the former State Security and the former Intelligence
management of the General Staff in its wording after the amendment by 8 8 of
ZID ZDDBDS exhaustively lists the documents that must be
available to establish the quality of a beneficiary who
leaves no room for subjectivism. And these people, like everyone else
others, have judicial protection under Art. bg, created with 8 11 of the AIS
Зддвдс.

According to the group of MPs, Art. Z, para. 1, 6. “e” of the Law
for access to the documents of the former State Security and the former
Intelligence Department of the General Staff in its wording after
the amendment with 6 5 of the AIS ZDDBDS was in contradiction with art. 31, para. 3 of
The constitution, according to which the accused is presumed innocent until
establishing the contrary with an effective sentence. This statement
also cannot be supported. The VAT Act does not provide as a consequence

the persons under art. 3, para. 1, 6. “is” to be found guilty or convicted of

the crime for which they have been charged in advance
production regardless of the cessation of production. On the contrary,
these persons are and remain unconvicted for this act and nothing changes in
their judicial past. The AIS of the VAT Act considers this circumstance
only as one of the conditions for disclosure,
provided by law, for these persons, but not with any others
consequences, including the consequences that the laws link to
condemnation.

The statement that in the law (8 3, with which it was amended) is also unfounded
Art. 2, 6 5, which amended Art. 3, para. 1, items 1, 8 8, which amended Art. 5,
al. 1, item 1) arbitrary interpretations of the written evidence were given and
a person appearing in any documents would be discredited
despite the fact that there is no evidence of cooperation. The law
exhaustively and in detail lists the documents on the basis of which
accepts as established whether the person has been a full-time, part-time employee
associate or beneficiary (art. 5, para. 2 et seq. in their wording
after the amendment by 8 8 of the AIS ZDDBDS) and these documents completely
comply with the legal definitions in 8 1 of the Additional
provisions in its wording after the amendment by 8 21 of the Amendments to the VAT Act.
Moreover, the legislator has created an explicit protection of persons under
in respect of which sufficient data are lacking to establish
their cooperation and this is clearly evident from the procedure regulated in Art. 5, para.
Zi sl., And from the explicit text of Art. 5, para. 4, as well as the ban on
publication in the report under Art. 3, para. 1, item 3 of the names of the persons under Art. 3,
al. 4 in their editions after the entry into force of the VAT Act.

According to the group of MPs, the affected citizens were
deprived of their right to defense, including judicial, contrary to
Art. 56 of the Constitution. This statement is not only unfounded, but also
incorrect - p8 11 of the AIS ZDDBDS is created art. 6 g, according to which persons
whose names are included in the report under Art. 3, para. 1, item 3 in contradiction with p

this law, may file against the commission under art. 4, para. 1 claim for

compensation under the State Liability for Damages Act,
caused to citizens.

4. Regarding the allegations for contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art. 6
of the Constitution

The request alleges that the AIS ZDDBDS contradicts Art. 6 from
The constitution because it created "discrimination," de facto lustration
in relation to the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens to be
elected or appointed to certain positions in the state ”. Like
a concrete example of this contradiction is cited 8 23 of the law.

Article 6 of the Constitution prohibits the establishment of restrictions
of rights or privileges based on race, nationality, ethnicity
affiliation, gender, origin, religion, education, beliefs,
political affiliation, personal and social status or
property status. It is not clear from the request which is exhaustive
the grounds listed in the constitutional text by the Members of Parliament
matured in the AIS ZDDBDS and specifically in 8 23 of the law. 8 23 settles hypotheses
of incompatibility between positions and activities and does not restrict rights
of citizens. Everyone can choose whether to borrow one or the other
public office, whether to carry out a public activity or not
cooperates with the security services. The perception of the statement of
MPs that this restricts the rights of citizens in
contrary to the Constitution, would mean that all laws that
establish incompatibility in the holding of certain positions,
such as Art. 132 of the Judiciary Act, Art. 7 of the Law on
the civil servant, art. 41 of the Local Self-Government Act and
local administration, etc., are unconstitutional.

5. Regarding the allegation of contradiction with the preamble, Art. 1 and
Art. 9 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, the disclosure of the "files"

thus directly affecting the national security of the State, a

the philosophy, spirit, and texts of the law were directly directed against
national security and statehood.

The law creates sufficient guarantees for the protection of
national security and this is clear from the texts included in it -
Art. 3, para. 2, items 1 and 2 of Art. 3, para. 4 in the wording after their amendment by 8 5 of
ZID ZDDBDS, art. 4d, para. 3, t. Tial. Article 4 4g after their creation c8 7
from ZID ZDDBDS. The mechanisms and procedures provided by law
ensure the protection of the information necessary for the national
security, while enabling society to
exercise its constitutionally proclaimed right to information.

The law does not deny continuity in specialized services and
this is also clear from Art. 3, para. 2, item 1 in the wording after its amendment by 8
B of the AIS ZDDBDS.

The argument in the request that it was possible to file many cases
v. the Republic of Bulgaria in the International Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, is unconvincing and irrelevant to the request - if the people
representatives believe that the law does not comply with generally accepted norms
of international law and of international treaties under which
The Republic of Bulgaria is a party, they should also make a request under Art.
149, para. 1, item 4 of the Constitution for declaring inconsistency with the law
with such norms or contracts.

In conclusion, and in view of the above, we consider that the request of
the group of MPs to establish
the unconstitutionality entirely of the Law for amendment and supplement
of the Law on Access to the Documents of the Former State Security (SG,
no. 24 of 2001) or alternatively to certain provisions of the law,

stated in the request is unfounded and should be rejected.


OPINION
from
The Council of Ministers of the Republic of Bulgaria
he

constitutional case Mo 7 for 2001

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,
DEAR MADAMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES,

By order of March 29, 2001, we were constituted as
interested party in the constitutional case Me 7 for 2001, initiated
at the request of 54 MPs from the 38th National Assembly for
establishing entirely the> unconstitutionality of the Law on
amendment of the Law on Access to the Documents of the Former
State Security (AIS ZDDBDS), promulgated in the State Gazette, issue
24 of 2001, or alternatively> to establish
the unconstitutionality of 8 6, 8 7 his part, with which art.
Agichl. 4e, 83, 85, 88, 821, 823 and 25 of the law.

1. Regarding the allegations of contradiction of the Amendments and Supplements to the VAT Act with Article
4, para. 1, art. 87, para. Tichl. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution

The request alleges that the AIS ZDDBDS contradicts Art. 4, para. That
The Constitution, as its adoption violated Art. 11, para. 1 of
The Law on Normative Acts (LNA) and Art. 68 Art. 69, para. 2 of the Regulations
for the organization and activity of the National Assembly (PODNS).

The violation of Art. 11, para. 1 of the LNA is justified by the fact that
The Law on Access to Documents of the Former State Security
(ZDDBDS), which is amended and supplemented, had 14 members located on 3
pages, while the draft of the National Assembly, originally submitted to the National Assembly
ZID ZDDBDS had 22 paragraphs, located on 7 pages, and the adopted one
was three times larger in volume than originally imported and was
located on 17 pages.

The violation of PODNS is justified by the fact that between the first and
second reading and after the deadlines for proposals was tabled
practically a new bill, which in principle differed from the adopted one
at the first vote and was “made by someone unknown and imported by someone unknown
whom ”. The fact that the bill was new was evident from its new title.

The Council of Ministers is not the submitter of the draft of the Law on Public Procurement Act,
therefore we do not have accurate information about the content
of the bill originally submitted to the National Assembly and
the amendments made between the first and second votes in
him. However, we believe that the above arguments of the group of people
representatives can not substantiate the conclusion of unconstitutionality of
of the law.

Possible violations in the legislative process could
lead to unconstitutionality of the law only if they are violations
of constitutional norms establishing requirements for the manner of
adoption of laws. When the law is passed in compliance with
the requirements of art. 87 Art. 88 of the Constitution, it cannot be argued that
violation or non - compliance with other procedural rules under
the adoption of the normative acts, established in LNA and PODNS, leads to
unconstitutional, as it was a violation of the principle of
the rule of law established in Art. 4, para. 1. The purpose of the LNA is to create
rules for the drafting of regulations relevant to
the application and interpretation of the acts. Article 11, para. 1 of the LNA is legal, and

non-constitutional norm and non-compliance with this text in the adoption of

a law cannot be a ground for unconstitutionality of the law.
Perceiving the opposite would mean that any special law would
was unconstitutional as adopted in violation of the constitutional
principle of the rule of law, as it establishes deviations
of the general order established by an effective law.

A conclusion in a similar sense follows from the reasons in Decision Me 5 of
1998 on constitutional case Co 2 for 1998, in which the Constitutional
the court held that:

“The assessment of constitutionality ... according to Art. 149, para. 1,
item 2 of the Constitution can be given only in view of this,
whether constitutional provisions and not other normative ones have been violated
acts introducing additional requirements and procedures (Decision Mo 3
since 1991 under k. e. Me 17 of 1991)

The provisions in PODNS do not have the rank of a constitutional norm and
their violation also cannot justify the unconstitutionality of
of the law. In this sense is the permanent practice of the Constitutional Court. IN
Judgment Me 3 of the Constitutional Court of 1992 in constitutional case Co
30 for 1991 states:

“Failure to comply with the rules of procedure of the> Rules of Procedure
the organization and activity of the National Assembly is not a violation of
constitutional norms. "The Constitutional Court does not discuss such
violations ”.

The opinion of the Constitutional Court is similar in its others
solutions. According to Decision Ke 3 of 1995 on constitutional case Mo 6 for
1995 the fact that Art. 73 of the Constitution explicitly provides
the establishment of PODNS does not attach to the regulations constitutional
nature and its provisions do not become and are not constitutional norms. IN
the same decision the Constitutional Court stated that it did not find grounds
to abandon his understanding expressed in constitutional case Mo 17 of
1991, and after the provisions of PODNS do not represent
constitutional "norms", then their violation does not lead to

unconstitutionality. For these reasons, the Constitutional Court is
held that the alleged violations of the PODNS in the request were irrelevant to
resolving the case and did not discuss in its decision whether these rules were
were violated. The same opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court and in
Decision Ke 7 of 1998 on constitutional case Me 5 for 1998 and in Decision
Ke 1 of 1999 in constitutional case Me 34 for 1998.

If, nevertheless, the Constitutional Court considers that it should
discusses the allegations of the MPs for admitted
violations of LNA and PODNS, we believe that they are unfounded. Article 11, para.
1 of the LNA stipulates that repeal of a law and its replacement with a new one is allowed
only when the changes are numerous and substantial. The purpose of is clear
the legal text and the introduction of the two cumulative requirements - to
limit the cases of repeal of an existing law and its replacement with a new one,
except when it is necessary to emphasize the essential difference between
both systems. It is not clear from the request why the MPs
consider that the changes are not only numerous but also significant as
they indicate only quantitative arguments for the number of paragraphs and pages,
on which the Law on Personal Income Tax is located. Indeed, the law contains
numerous changes, but it does not rearrange in a new, fundamentally different way
way matter. It creates a more detailed arrangement in line with the reasons
of Decision Mo 10 of the Constitutional Court of 1997 on constitutional
Case No 14 of 1997 concerning the authorities carrying out the inspection under
the law, the place of the Constitutional Court and the president in the system of
state bodies, the obligation of the state to legally guarantee
the dignity and rights of the individual, while ensuring the right
of public information. The VAT Act does not change the purpose or
the subject of the law, which is amended and supplemented, which means that there is not
grounds for adoption of a new law.

The allegations of violations of Art. 68 and
Art. 69, para. 2 of PODNS. The law, whether it amends or supplements
another law or creates a primary regulation of public relations is one thing

as a whole, bound by a common goal and principles. The adoption of the law in two
voting gives the opportunity to cover all the relationships that
should be settled by it. That is why the Constitution does not restrict
the legislator 's ability to supplement or amend the drafts of the
laws between the two votes. In accordance with it, Art. 68, para. 1 of
PODNS explicitly allows not only amendments but also additions to the adopted of
first vote bill, and Art. 69, para. 3 of PODNS puts
restrictions only on the discussion and voting of proposals which
contradict the principles of the bill passed at first vote,
but not for proposals that complement the bill without
contradict its principles. The request does not indicate which of
the principles in the bill passed at the first vote contradict
the texts supplemented and amended in the second ballot, which would be
necessary to substantiate the allegations of the MPs
for contradiction with art. 69, para. 2 of PODNS.

According to the group of MPs between the first and second
voting in the committee of the National Assembly was introduced practically new
a bill that was "apocryphal" and "mysterious" because they were not in it
neither names nor signatures were noted. That meant the law
was adopted by a single vote and was not submitted by MPs
or by the Council of Ministers, i.e. in violation of Art. 87, para. 1 art. 88, para. 1
of the Constitution.

The draft of the Law on Public Procurement Act was submitted by MPs to
compliance with Art. 87, para. 1 was adopted by two votes in accordance with
Art. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution. This is not denied by the group of people
representatives, as in the request they indicate the incoming number of
bill and describe the actions taken between the two votes in
National Assembly. Therefore, the constitutional requirements of Art.
87, para. Tichl. 88, para. 1 are observed. The request does not indicate why the people
Representatives believe that the bill passed in the second vote is

"Fundamentally different from the one adopted at the first vote", as principled

a difference between two bills cannot be justified solely by
the volume of the bill, with the number of paragraphs in it and with the number of
the pages on which it is located. The content requirements of
the bills and the assumptions of the MPs, to
the deadlines for submission and the manner of their certification, which are
established in PODNS, in acts of the Speaker of the National Assembly
or in the practical work of parliament and its committees, cannot
justify a violation of Art. 87, para. 1 art. 88, para. 1 of the Constitution.

In this sense is the Decision Me 1 of the Constitutional Court of 1999.
in Constitutional Case 34 for 1998, which states:

"The law ... was passed in two separate votes
meetings, which is in full compliance with the requirements of Art. 88, para. 1.
Assoc. first of the Constitution. "Possible violation of procedural
rules not provided for in the Constitution, but in the PODNS, do not lead to its
violation. The fact that PODNS itself is subject to control for
constitutionality, shows that its non-observance cannot be
equated with a violation of the Constitution. ”

2. Regarding the allegations of contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art. 8,
Art. 117 et seq., Art. 153 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, Art. 4 in its wording after
the amendment with 8 6 of the AISA 4a, established by 8 7 of the Amendments to the VAT Act,
which provides for the establishment of a commission of 7 members, 5 of whom are elected
from the National Assembly, and 2 - from the Council of Ministers, were
unconstitutional, as the majority in the National Assembly
would appoint 5 members, and the Council of Ministers, which was elected by
this majority would appoint the other two members. That meant that
this commission will not be an impartial body, but it will be
political body.

The request does not indicate which constitutional text or principle
the disputed texts contradict. Nevertheless, we do not find

contradiction between these texts and the Constitution as they are

compliant on the one hand with the constitutional principle of division of
the authorities, on the other hand, take into account the interests of all political forces,
represented in parliament. According to Art. 4a, para. 1, item 1 of the Access Act
to the documents of the former State Security and the former Intelligence
management of the General Staff members of the commission from the quota of
The National Assembly is elected on the proposal of various
parliamentary groups. Therefore, the representatives of the parliamentary
opposition will have the same rights and the same access to information as well
representatives of the parliamentary majority and the government. From
on the other hand, the decision to disclose the information is
assigned to a committee set up in such a way as to exclude the participation of
the legislature and the Council of Ministers. The method of compiling
the commission, as well as the overall regulation in the law, create enough
guarantees for the realization of the purposes of the law under the conditions of
equality and objectivity.

The request also claims that 8 7 in its part, which creates Art.
4d, contradicts Art. 8, Art. 117 et seq. And Art. 153 of the Constitution.
The commission under art. 4d, whose members are appointed by the President,
the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Attorney General would
be a "covert" political body carrying out political orders ",
because the president was the representative of the majority and the president
of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General were appointed by him.

We will not comment on the allegations in the request for so-called “explainable
bias ”of the President, the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and
the Attorney General, as we believe that such qualifications are
inadmissible, especially within the framework of the Constitution
procedure for challenging the constitutionality of a law.

According to Art. 92, para. Tichl. 93, para. 1 of the Constitution the President
embodies the unity of the nation and is elected directly by the electorate.
The President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General

appointed by the President on the proposal of the Supreme Judicial Council at

the conditions of art. 129, para. 2 of the Constitution. The conditions for her election
the release of these bodies ensures their independence and
exclude the possibility of political pressure on them
or influence. It is the way of forming this commission that will
makes the final decision to disclose the information, creates
guarantee its objectivity and impartiality and exclude
the possibility of it being a political body.

The allegations that 8 7 in the part with which it is
creates art. 4d, contradicts the constitutional principle of division of
authorities, of Art. 117 et seq. And of Art. 153 of the Constitution, as he assigned
of the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General
powers they did not have, which in turn meant an amendment and
addition to the Constitution in contradiction with Art. 153. There is no violation
of Art. 8 of the Constitution and the principle of separation of powers, as
as the law does not seize or shift constitutional functions between
individual authorities.

The Constitutional Court has had occasion to rule in connection with
the separation of powers and the interaction between them. In Decision Mo 6
of the Constitutional Court of 1993 in constitutional case Ho 4 of 1993,
is called:

"The legal and political content of the term" division of
authorities ”consists in the fact that the state power has three main spheres of
manifestation assigned to three main systems of organs that are
relatively independent of each other and function in a certain
mutual connection. We are talking about the three main functions of the state
power, i.e. distinguishing competence between the three groups of bodies, not
some kind of triumph excluded from the rule of the modern state.
.... The scientific explanation requires that account be taken of the fact that there is none
The "Great Wall of China" between the various authorities, that they interact with each other
and that in the end they are manifestations of the unified state power and

sovereignty. This is the idea embedded in Art. 8 of the Constitution ...

Moreover, the commission under Art. 4d is not a court panel and it does not
powers of a judicial authority. This is clear from its powers,
specified in the law. The statement in the request that the authorities of
the judiciary appoints from its system other bodies of
the executive branch - the chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation and
the Attorney General does not appoint the commission as a collegial body of
executive power, and nominate individual members. Permanently
established practice in the operation of the 1991 Constitution is
the appointment of magistrates in the central election commissions for
holding parliamentary and presidential elections, as well as
the appointment in these cases is made by non-judicial bodies
power such as the President and the National Assembly. The perception of
the claim of MPs that the participation of magistrates in
bodies outside the judiciary are unconstitutional
meant that the elections in which magistrates participated in
election commissions were produced in violation of the Constitution.
On the contrary, the participation of magistrates in the commission and a representative of
the President, as well as the conditions for the appointment and dismissal of
the members of the commission shall establish guarantees of its impartiality,
objectivity and independence.

The Constitution does not exhaustively regulate the powers of the chief
prosecutor and the chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation. Article 133 of
The Constitution refers to a law on organization and structure
of the judiciary, which also regulates the powers of
the President of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Prosecutor General. If
accept that the conferral of powers by law on the President of
The Supreme Court of Cassation and the "Chief Prosecutor" is
unconstitutional, this would mean that the texts in the Act on
the judiciary and in procedural laws in their part concerning
the powers of these bodies are unconstitutional because

supplement and amend the Constitution.

The request also disputes 8 7 in the part with which Art. 4d,
arguing that the text which provides for the establishment of working groups by
executive authorities has been unconstitutional since
the ministers and the other heads of the bodies under art. 4d bili
representatives of the ruling political formation and those appointed by
their primary commissions would carry out party orders.

We believe that the law contains sufficient guarantees of objectivity
and the impartiality of the law enforcement authorities. Does not respond
to the truth the statement that the working groups would make subjective
judgment. The working groups do only preparatory work, but they do not
decide to disclose the information. Moreover, the law does not
allows subjective judgment, as it exhaustively states
what documents should be available to make one or the other
conclusion regarding the activity of the person - art. 5, para. 2 in its wording after
the amendment with 8 8 of the Amendments to the VAT Act. Decisions are made by
the commission under art. 4d, the method of compiling which guarantees
its objectivity and impartiality, and every citizen has the right to
judicial protection against wrongful acts committed in violation of
of the law - art. bg, created with 8 11 of the AIS ZDDBDS.

3. Regarding the allegations for contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art.
4, para. 2, Art. 32, para. 2, Art. 38 and Art. 56 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, the law contradicts
the constitutional texts mentioned and the principles in the preamble of
The Constitution that the basic law protects the citizen from discrediting, from
damage to his good name, honor and dignity.

The issue of the compliance of the VAT Act with the constitutional one
the guaranteed right of citizens to information and constitutionally
the established obligation of the state to defend citizens from
discrediting and damaging their good name, honor and dignity, is
clarified in detail in the reasons of Decision Me 10 of the Constitutional Court of

1997 in constitutional case Mo 14 for 1997. In the case it was also

a request was made to declare the unconstitutionality entirely on
VATA, which was rejected by the Constitutional Court. In the reasons of
the decision states that the right of society to receive
information “that> is of interest to him is essential
constitutional right enshrined in Art. 41, para. 1 of the Constitution. When
legislation on the right to information, as is the case with
VATA, the state is obliged to comply with the restrictions specified in
this constitutional text and to provide legal guarantees for the protection of
listed in Art. 41, para 1 of the Constitution constitutional values ​​and
fundamental rights - the rights and reputation of citizens, the national
security, public order, public health and morality.

We believe that the AIS of the VAT Act is fully compliant with the motives in
the said decision of the Constitutional Court. The law regulates in detail
the conditions and the order for disclosure of information and the right to judicial
protection of citizens and does not link the disclosed information to any
either negative consequences or restriction of the rights of individuals,
whose names are disclosed in the prescribed order. The statement in
the demand that the law create conditions for the persecution of citizens
due to their beliefs in contradiction with Art. 38 of the Constitution. One
of the merits of the law is that it does not contain an evaluative moment and does not
imposes on> legislative order a certain moral conclusion, such as
at the same time, it provides for the disclosure of sufficient data to enable it to do so
every citizen to judge from the point of view of his own morality and
views in each case whether the activity was
worthy of respect or has been reprehensible. Therefore it cannot be
argues that the law infringes on the dignity and rights of the individual and
violates Art. 4, para. 2 and Art. 38 of the Constitution. On the contrary, he only
provides an opportunity for citizens to receive the same form and
content information. The dignity and good name of the citizens
could only be harmed if they were dealing with

anti-social and reprehensible activity, which is why they do not want to

society to know about it. We believe that in this case not the law, but
their conscious activity has damaged their dignity and reputation,
and that in comparing their interest with the law of society
of information should undoubtedly be given priority to the right of
information society.

The allegations of contradiction with Art. 32, para. 2 of the Constitution are
incompatible with the law - on the one hand this constitutional text
allows exceptions provided by law, and on the other hand, the Law on Personal Income Tax does not
provides for tracking, photographing, filming, recording of persons,
whose names will be disclosed under the conditions and in the manner provided therein.

The request alleges that the notion of "beneficiaries"
used in 6 7, 8 8, 8 21 and others. it was so "stretchy" that it gave
opportunity for subjective judgment and for discrediting the persons
judgment. We do not share this statement with MPs, no
only in so far as it concerns the defamation for the reasons already mentioned,
and his share of subjective judgment. In Art. 5, para. 3 of the Access Act
to the documents of the former State Security and the former Intelligence
management of the General Staff in its wording after the amendment by 8 8 of
ZID ZDDBDS exhaustively lists the documents that must be
available to establish the quality of a beneficiary who
leaves no room for subjectivism. And these people, like everyone else
others, have judicial protection under Art. bg, created with 8 11 of the AIS
Зддвдс.

According to the group of MPs, Art. Z, para. 1, 6. “e” of the Law
for access to the documents of the former State Security and the former
Intelligence Department of the General Staff in its wording after
the amendment with 6 5 of the AIS ZDDBDS was in contradiction with art. 31, para. 3 of
The constitution, according to which the accused is presumed innocent until
establishing the contrary with an effective sentence. This statement
also cannot be supported. The VAT Act does not provide as a consequence

the persons under art. 3, para. 1, 6. “is” to be found guilty or convicted of

the crime for which they have been charged in advance
production regardless of the cessation of production. On the contrary,
these persons are and remain unconvicted for this act and nothing changes in
their judicial past. The AIS of the VAT Act considers this circumstance
only as one of the conditions for disclosure,
provided by law, for these persons, but not with any others
consequences, including the consequences that the laws link to
condemnation.

The statement that in the law (8 3, with which it was amended) is also unfounded
Art. 2, 6 5, which amended Art. 3, para. 1, items 1, 8 8, which amended Art. 5,
al. 1, item 1) arbitrary interpretations of the written evidence were given and
a person appearing in any documents would be discredited
despite the fact that there is no evidence of cooperation. The law
exhaustively and in detail lists the documents on the basis of which
accepts as established whether the person was a full-time associate, a part-time employee
associate or beneficiary (art. 5, para. 2 et seq. in their wording
after the amendment by 8 8 of the Amendments to the VAT Act) and these documents in full
comply with the legal definitions in 8 1 of the Additional
provisions in its wording after the amendment by 8 21 of the Amendments to the VAT Act.
Moreover, the legislator has created an explicit protection of persons under
in respect of which sufficient data are lacking to establish
their cooperation and this is clearly evident from the procedure regulated in Art. 5, para.
Zi sl., And from the explicit text of Art. 5, para. 4, as well as the ban on
publication in the report under Art. 3, para. 1, item 3 of the names of the persons under Art. 3,
al. 4 in their editions after the entry into force of the VAT Act.

According to the group of MPs, the affected citizens were
deprived of their right to defense, including judicial, contrary to
Art. 56 of the Constitution. This statement is not only unfounded, but also
incorrect - p8 11 of the AIS ZDDBDS is created art. 6 g, according to which persons
whose names are included in the report under Art. 3, para. 1, item 3 in contradiction with p

this law, may file against the commission under art. 4, para. 1 claim for

compensation under the State Liability for Damages Act,
caused to citizens.

4. Regarding the allegations for contradiction of the AIS of the VAT Act with Art. 6
of the Constitution

The request alleges that the AIS ZDDBDS contradicts Art. 6 from
The constitution because it created "discrimination," de facto lustration
in relation to the constitutionally guaranteed rights of citizens to be
elected or appointed to certain positions in the state ”. Like
a concrete example of this contradiction is cited 8 23 of the law.

Article 6 of the Constitution prohibits the establishment of restrictions
of rights or privileges based on race, nationality, ethnicity
affiliation, gender, origin, religion, education, beliefs,
political affiliation, personal and social status or
property status. It is not clear from the request which is exhaustive
the grounds listed in the constitutional text by the Members of Parliament
matured in the AIS ZDDBDS and specifically in 8 23 of the law. 8 23 settles hypotheses
of incompatibility between positions and activities and does not restrict rights
of citizens. Everyone can choose whether to borrow one or the other
public office, whether to carry out a public activity or not
cooperates with the security services. The perception of the statement of
MPs that this restricts the rights of citizens in
contrary to the Constitution, would mean that all laws that
establish incompatibility in the holding of certain positions,
such as Art. 132 of the Judiciary Act, Art. 7 of the Law on
the civil servant, art. 41 of the Local Self-Government Act and
local administration, etc., are unconstitutional.

5. Regarding the allegation of contradiction with the preamble, Art. 1 and
Art. 9 of the Constitution

According to the group of MPs, the disclosure of the "files"

thus directly affecting the national security of the State, a

the philosophy, spirit, and texts of the law were directly directed against
national security and statehood.

The law creates sufficient guarantees for the protection of
national security and this is clear from the texts included in it -
Art. 3, para. 2, items 1 and 2 of Art. 3, para. 4 in the wording after their amendment by 8 5 of
ZID ZDDBDS, art. 4d, para. 3, t. Tial. Article 4 4g after their creation c8 7
from ZID ZDDBDS. The mechanisms and procedures provided by law
ensure the protection of the information necessary for the national
security, while enabling society to
exercise its constitutionally proclaimed right to information.

The law does not deny continuity in specialized services and
this is also clear from Art. 3, para. 2, item 1 in the wording after its amendment by 8
B of the AIS ZDDBDS.

The argument in the request that it was possible to file many cases
v. the Republic of Bulgaria in the International Court of Human Rights in
Strasbourg, is unconvincing and irrelevant to the request - if the people
representatives believe that the law does not comply with generally accepted norms
of international law and of international treaties under which
The Republic of Bulgaria is a party, they should also make a request under Art.
149, para. 1, item 4 of the Constitution for declaring inconsistency with the law
with such norms or contracts.

In conclusion, and in view of the above, we consider that the request of
the group of MPs to establish
the unconstitutionality entirely of the Law for amendment and supplement
of the Law on Access to the Documents of the Former State Security (SG,
no. 24 of 2001) or alternatively to certain provisions of the law,

stated in the request is unfounded and should be rejected.
