Opinion of Judge Nedelcho Beronov

In Article 35, paragraphs 1 and 5 of the Law on Protection of Classified Information

The wording of the provision does not specify whether the register provided for in it is public or not .

The first paragraph of the provision provides , that will be leading a register of materials and documents , containing classified information , constituting state or official secret . In this his part provision sets for what will be leading the register , but not its content . The last one is exhaustively stated in the second paragraph of the same Article 35 ZZKI.Sashtestvuvaneto of two paragraphs is an indicator , that each of them has different subject of legal regulation . The nature of the register is determined by its content and not by the occasion and purpose for creating it . The register contains data on the circumstances exhaustively listed in paragraph 2 of Article 35 of the CIPA . Neither one of them not been included in the list of categories of information , subject to qualification as a state secret ( application â„– 1 to Article 25 CIPA). Once the register does not contain data , representing state secret , he is not able to be secret , but public .

This understanding is expressed and presented in the case opinions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and of National Service " Security ", ie . the state institutions , which have a direct relation to the application of CIPA and in particular of its art. 35, para 1 and 5.
