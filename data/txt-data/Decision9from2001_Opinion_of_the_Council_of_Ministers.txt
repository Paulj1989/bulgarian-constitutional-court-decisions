on

constitutional case Mo 9 for 2001

DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,

DEAR MADAMENTS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES,

By order of 19 April 2001, we were constituted as
interested party in constitutional case Mo 9 for 2001,
formed at the request of 50 MPs from the 38th National Assembly
meeting for obligatory interpretation of art. 65, para. 2 and Art. 68, para. 1 of
The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria.

With the said ruling, the Constitutional Court allowed for
consideration on the merits of the request for interpretation of Art. 65, para. 2 of
The Constitution in the sense of “whether the Prime Minister, the Deputy
prime ministers and ministers hold public office under
the meaning of Art. 65, para. 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria ”.

As stated in the request of the group of MPs,
The Constitutional Court has already had occasion to express its opinion
on the meaning of the term "civil service" with which it is used

in the Constitution and in particular as to the meaning with which it is
used in Art. 68, para. 1 of the Constitution. In the reasons for Decision Mo.
Bot 1993 on constitutional case Me 6 for 1993 states:

“In the Constitution, apart from Art. 68, para. 1 for civil service
speaks in Art. 65, para. 2. The concept is the basis of the provision of art.
116. It is common ground that the term 'civil service' must be understood as
unified and consistent meaning. In general, this is an activity on
performing the functions of the state. This activity is performed
on behalf of the state and to exercise the powers provided for
in the Constitution its organs. "

The same opinion was expressed by the Constitutional Court in a Decision
Me 16 of 1997 on constitutional case Me 8 of 1997.

We fully share the opinion of the Constitutional Court
on the unified and uncontroversial meaning of the term “state
service ”as an activity for performing the functions of the state,
which is done on behalf of the state and for implementation
the powers of its bodies provided for in the Constitution. The activity,
which is carried out by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Minister
presidents and ministers as sole bodies of state power and
as members of the highest collegial body of the executive branch
it is indisputably an activity for the performance of the functions of the state which
they perform on behalf of the state and to exercise their powers
of its constitutional bodies. Therefore, they occupy the state
service within the meaning of the grounds of the decision of
The Constitutional Court. However, to determine whether occupied by them
civil service is included in the scope of the term "civil service" under
Art. 65, para. 2 of the Constitution, it is necessary to assess not only
the nature of their activity, as well as the constitutional law
status of the Council of Ministers and its members. This also follows
of the reasons in the cited decision of the Constitutional Court, in which
says:

“.. in the absence of an unambiguous doctrinal or legal
definition of civil service the meaning and content of

22

the concept in individual cases must be disclosed in accordance with
the specific objectives of the regulations and the institutes to which it relates ...
However, this most general meaning of the term "civil service" does not exclude
and the peculiarities with which it is used in the Constitution and which it
acquires depending on its specific systematic place and from
the relevant legal institute with which it is directly related. Not possible
for example, to have an absolute coincidence in scope of the concept in Art. 68, para.
1 art. 116. The logical and systematic interpretation of the two texts
leads to the conclusion that in Art. 116 refers only to one type of state
service - in the field of executive power, the state
administration in the proper sense of the word. While in Art. 68, para. 1 is available
given the wider scope of the concept. (The discrepancy from the point of view of
volume does not mean a contradiction in the general sense of the term, it
expresses only the differences between the types of civil service). "

Clarification of the meaning of the term “civil service” under Art.
65, para. 2 of the Constitution in view of the constitutional status of
The Council of Ministers and its members, regulated in Chapter Five of
The Constitution, in our opinion, imposes the conclusion that this concept does not include
the office of “Prime Minister,” Deputy 5 Minister-
presidents and ministers.

According to Chapter Five of the Constitution, ministers are sole proprietors
executive bodies, which are also members of
the collegial body of the executive power - the Council of Ministers.
The Council of Ministers as a collegial body composed of
the President, the Deputy Prime Ministers and Ministers,
manages and implements the domestic and foreign policy of the country,
ensures public order and national security, implements
the general management of the state administration and the Armed Forces,
directs the "implementation" of the state | budget, ”he organized
the management of the state property, concludes, approves and
denounce international treaties in the cases provided by law.

The members of the Council of Ministers receive their powers,

which the Constitution and laws connect only with them, through

their election by the National Assembly as provided for in the Constitution
ed. The Prime Minister is also a member of the Council of Ministers
directs and coordinates the general policy of the government and bears
responsibility for it, the deputy prime ministers and ministers are
members of the Council of Ministers and are responsible for their actions.
The powers of the Council of Ministers cannot be obtained in this way
to transfer to another. Ministers may, by order, delegate to
Deputy Ministers powers and determine their functions (Art.
26, para. 2 of the Administration Act), but they cannot delegate to them
powers which fall within their exclusive competence under
The Constitution and the laws. This applies above all to power
to be members of the Council of Ministers and to participate in the formation
at the will of the collegial body.

In view of the provisions of Chapter Five of the Constitution, if any
accept that in accordance with Art. 65, para. 2 of the Constitution, the articles of
The Council of Ministers, which have registered to participate in the elections,
retain their powers but suspend their functions,
their constitutional and legal functions remain without a bearer in this
period of time and in practice will not be able to be implemented. If
more than half of the members of the Council of Ministers have
registered for participation in the elections, the government as a collegial body
he could not work and fulfill the tasks assigned to him by the Constitution
functions. And the functions that the Constitution assigns to the government,
are of a nature that does not allow them to be interrupted in any
moment. Apparently this conclusion is shared by the constitutional legislator,
who has created an explicit regulation in such a sense - Art. 111, para. 3 of
The Constitution provides that upon termination of the powers of
The Council of Ministers also resigns before the newly elected
National Assembly The Council of Ministers continues to implement
until the election of a new Council of Ministers. After
The Constitution does not allow interruption of the performance of the functions of
The Council of Ministers even in the event of terminated powers under
Art. 111 of the Constitution, there is no reason to claim that it does not

only allows, and even requires such an interruption, and during
the operation of the powers of the Council of Ministers, as is the case
under Art. 65, para. 2 of the Constitution.

The constitutional requirement of Art. 65, para. 2 was played
incl. 49, para. 1 of the repealed Law on Election of Members of Parliament,
municipal councilors and mayors. By Decision of 13 September 1991 on
the legal status of the members of the Council of Ministers who registered
as candidates in parliamentary elections (SG, issue 80 of 1991)
The Grand National Assembly accepted that the provision of Art. 49, para. 1 of
ZINPOSK does not cover the Prime Minister, Deputy Minister-
presidents and ministers and that their powers continue to
are also performed after the registration for participation in the elections
due to the special status of the Council of Ministers as a supreme central council
constitutional body of the executive power. In Decision Me 2 of 1991.
of the Constitutional Court in constitutional case Me 24 for 1991 on the occasion
this decision of the Grand National Assembly reads:

"In connection with the elections for MPs, municipal
councilors and mayors, held on October 13, 1991, the People's
meeting with a decision of 13 September 1991 reasonably accepted that Art. 49
ZINPOSK does not apply to the members of the Ministerial
advice if they participate in the election, as in view of the functions and
the responsibilities of its members the country cannot be left without
incumbent government. ”

The group of MPs have requested the Constitutional
court to rule on the interpretation of the terms "ministers" and
"Members of the Council of Ministers", "Council of Ministers" and "government".
We do not believe that these concepts are controversial in theory and practice.
Nevertheless, we note that in our opinion with the concept
"Government" means the supreme> collegial body of
the executive branch, as the name defined in the Constitution
of the Bulgarian government is the Council of Ministers. Members of
The Council of Ministers are the Prime Minister, the Deputy
the chairmen and the ministers according to art. 108, para. 1 of the Constitution,

which means that every minister is a member of the Council of Ministers, but not
each member of the Council of Ministers must be a minister insofar as
the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Ministers may also
not to be ministers.

Given the above, we believe that in the scope of the concept
"Civil service" under Art. 65, para. 2 of the Constitution are not included
the ‘posts’ of the Prime Minister, 4 | Deputy Minister-
presidents and ministers.

FOR THE PRIME MINISTER:
