Dissenting opinion of Judge Lyudmil Neykov I find illegal the election of Irena Ivanova Marinova - Varadinova, appointed MP by Decision of the CEC № 348 of June 20, 2001 in the XXXIX National Assembly by the coalition "National Movement Simeon II" in the 18th multi-member electorate district - Razgrad. Decision № 90 of 9.06.2001 of the District Election Commission - Razgrad for annulment of the registration of Ventsislav Assenov Dimitrov, candidate for MP from the NMSS list was declared null and void by a decision of the SAC of 15 June 2001. This eliminated the grounds for the additional registration of Irena Marinova - Varadinova in the place of Ventsislav Dimitrov, as the annulled act of the REC - Razgrad practically did not give rise to any legal consequences. In view of this, the candidate for MP Irena Marinova - Varadinova was illegally subsequently included as a leader in the ballot of the NMSS coalition, with which she voted. The fact that she was voted with the ballot in which she appears as a leader and received the appropriate number of votes required for the election, can not remedy the offense by including it in the ballot, respectively. to give legal form to her choice. Therefore, her choice cannot be recognized as lawful. It is illegal.
