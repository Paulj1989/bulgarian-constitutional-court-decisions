The Constitutional Court is requested to rule on the dispute over the legality of the election of MP Irena Ivanova Marinova-Varadinova. She was declared an elected member of the XXXIX National Assembly by the Simeon II National Movement coalition on 18. multi-member constituency - Razgrad. The MPs in question support the request of Ventseslav Assenov Dimitrov, addressed to them in accordance with the procedure and within the terms of Article 112 of the Law on the Election of Members of Parliament (ZINP) - SG, iss. 37/2001. By a ruling of 9.07.2001 the Constitutional Court allowed the request for examination on the merits. The National Assembly, the Council of Ministers, the Supreme Administrative Court (SAC), the Central Election Commission (CEC), the Simeon II National Movement (NMSS) coalition, Irena Ivanova Marinova-Varadinova and Ventseslav Assenov Dimitrov were constituted with the same definition as interested parties in the case. .On 5.07.2001 a request with the same subject was received by the General Assembly of the SAC, on which a constitutional case № 14/2001 was initiated. With a ruling of 12.07.2001 this request was also admitted for consideration on the merits. Due to the identity of the two cases and the need to issue a joint decision with the ruling c.d. № 14/2001 was joined to c.d. № 13/2001. The applicants maintain that the election of Irena Marinova - Varadinova was made in violation of Art. 48, para 5 and Art. 74, para 2 of the Law on Public Procurement, as well as of Decision /1 10/1997 of the Constitutional court under c.d. № 14/97 (promulgated, SG No. 89/97) The CEC and Ventseslav Dimitrov submitted opinions on the case. The CEC maintains that the requests are unfounded, as the parliamentary elections are held on the proportional electoral basis. system with electoral lists of parties and coalitions according to ZINP. In view of this, a participant in the election process is the relevant political force and it depends on how many and who will be the registered candidates for MPs. In view of the above, individuals are not participants in the election process on their own grounds and are not entitled to challenge the actions of the election administration. Ventseslav Dimitrov refers to a number of decisions of the SAC, which revoked and declared null and void acts of the election administration. As a result, he should have been registered as the leader of the NMSS electoral list in the 18th multi-member constituency - Razgrad, and not Irena Marinova - Varadinova. The Constitutional Court, after discussing the considerations developed in the requests, the opinions of the parties and the attached to the case evidence, accepted the following: Initially, as the leader of the pre-election list of the NMSS coalition for the elections of 17.06.2001 in the 18th multi-member constituency - Razgrad, the district election commission (REC) registered Ventseslav Dimitrov (Decision № 29 / 16.05. By Decision № 90 of 9 June 2001, the REC annulled its registration on the grounds of Article 48, paragraph 5 of the Law on Public Procurement (due to data in the file for cooperation with the former State Security) at the request of the NMSS coalition and his place was registered by the said Irena Marinova - Varadinova. At the same time, the CEC with Decision № 330 / 13.06.2001 left without consideration the appeal of Ventseslav Dimitrov against the decision of the DEC. The Supreme Administrative Court with Decision № 4421/2001 of 15.06.2001 under Adm. № 4806/2001 annulled this decision of the CEC and annulled the decision of the DEC - Razgrad to cancel the registration of Ventseslav Dimitrov in the candidate list. The SAC had already ruled with Decision № 4270 of 13.06.2001. according to adm.d. № 4623/2001, annulling Decision № 288 of 5 June 2001 of the CEC, according to which data on cooperation with the former State Security (DS) for a person may be established by a certificate from the dossier commission. of the judicial act, the DEC took Decision № 131 of 16 June 2001, according to which Ventseslav Dimitrov should be re-registered as the leader of the NMSS coalition's election list. On the same day, the CEC, by Decision № 345 of 16 June 2001, annulled the REC decision in its entirety. As a result, on the day of the elections in the 18th multi-member constituency - Razgrad, the name of Irena Marinova - Varadinova appeared in the ballot paper of the NMSS coalition. Therefore, by Decision № 348 of 20.06.2001 of the CEC (SG, issue 56/2001) it was declared elected MP by the NMSS coalition in this constituency. In the meantime, the previous day - 19.06.2001. with Decision № 4598/2001, ruled under Adm. № 4908/2001, the SAC annulled the decision of the CEC under № 345 of 16.06.2001 in the part by which Decision № 131 / 16.06.2001 of the REC was revoked. The provision of Art. .1 of the Constitution assigns the courts to control the legality of the acts and actions of the administrative bodies. The election administration is not excluded from this control. In a state governed by the rule of law - Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Basic Law, judicial acts are binding on the parties to the case and enjoy the force of res judicata. In view of this, the decisions of the SAC, which revoked and declared null and void acts of the DEC and CEC, are binding on these bodies and are enforceable. Failure to comply with court decisions by the election administration can only hold the state liable for damages from illegal actions of its bodies towards the affected persons - art. 7 of the Constitution. However, this non-fulfillment cannot lead to the illegality of the election of Irena Marinova-Varadinova. It should be borne in mind that on the day of the elections - June 17, 2001, she appeared both as the leader of the candidate list of the NMSS coalition and in the ballot in the 18th multi-member constituency - Razgrad. Thus, the provision of Art. 74, para 2 of the Law on Public Procurement is observed, according to which the identity of the names and the order of the persons in the candidate list and the ballot paper is required. Irena Marinova - Varadinova meets the requirements for MP under Art. of the Constitution. It is included in the pre-election list in accordance with the procedure provided for in the ZINP - at the will and by a proper request of the central leadership of the NMSS Coalition. This happened within the term under art. 48, para 5, sentence last ZINP. The ballot paper with her name has received the necessary vote of the voter in accordance with the provision of art. 87, para 2, item 1 of the Law on Public Procurement. This also applies to Bulgarian citizens who voted abroad, as can be seen from letter № 55-00-31 of 11 July 2001 of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. That is why it was correctly announced by the CEC as an MP from the NMSV coalition. Such is the will of the party coalition, which nominated Irena Varadinova as a candidate for MP. According to Decision №1 / 1994 under c.d. № 22/93 of the Constitutional Court, political parties and coalitions are subject to the right to nominate candidates and make changes in the election lists. Coalition NMSS requested annulment of the leader of the list and later did not declare another will on this issue. In view of the above and on the grounds of Article 149, paragraph 1, item 7 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court RESOLVED: Rejects the requests of 57 Members of the XXXIX National Assembly and the General Assembly of the Supreme Administrative Court for declaring illegal the election of Irena Ivanova Marinova - Varadinova, appointed Member of Parliament by decision of the CEC № 348 of 20.06.2001 in the XXXIX National Assembly of Coalition "National Movement Simeon II" in the 18th multi-member constituency - Razgrad.
