The applicants consider that the principles of the rule of law and the separation of powers - Article 4, paragraph 1 and Article 8 of the Constitution, as well as the autonomy and independence of the judiciary - Article 117, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law have been substantially violated. . They maintain that the eventual declaration of unconstitutionality of the above-mentioned provisions of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities deprives the law of internal logic and consistency and asks in this case the Constitutional Court to declare it completely unconstitutional.

By a ruling of 29 October 2002, the request was admitted for examination on the merits, with the exception of § 49 of the Act.

With the same definition as interested parties in the case are constituted: the National Assembly, the President of the Republic of Bulgaria, the Council of Ministers, the Minister of Justice, the Supreme Judicial Council, the Supreme Administrative Court, the Prosecutor General, the National Investigation Service, the Sofia Court of Appeal, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal Court of Appeal, Varna Court of Appeal, Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal, Military Court of Appeal, Sofia Appellate Prosecutor's Office, Plovdiv Appellate Prosecutor's Office, Burgas Appellate Prosecutor's Office, Varna Appellate Prosecutor's Office, Veliko Tarnovo Appellate Prosecutor's Office, Military Prosecutor's Office , The Association of Prosecutors in Bulgaria and the Chamber of Investigators in Bulgaria.

In support of the request, the General Prosecutor, the Sofia Court of Appeal, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal, the Varna Court of Appeal, the Burgas Court of Appeal, the Veliko Tarnovo Court of Appeal, the Military Court of Appeal, the Sofia Court of Appeal, the Plovdiv Court of Appeal and the Plovdiv Court of Appeal , The Military Appellate Prosecutor's Office, the Union of Judges in Bulgaria and the Association of Prosecutors in Bulgaria.

Arguments for rejecting the request were presented by the National Assembly, the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Justice.

The other parties did not submit comments.

The Constitutional Court, after considering the considerations developed in the request, the views of the parties and the evidence attached to the case, held the following:

I. On increasing the powers of the executive

 

A number of the challenged provisions of the Act on the Protection of the Judiciary extend the powers of the executive branch to the judiciary, namely:

- § 3, v.1, b. “D” in the part, which creates a new item 10 in art. 27, para 1 JSA, enables the Minister of Justice to summarize an annual report on the activity of the courts, prosecutor's offices and investigative services;

- § 6, which amends Art. 30, para 1 JSA, provides for the proposals for determining the number of judges, prosecutors and investigators, as well as for their appointment, promotion, demotion, transfer and dismissal to be made until The Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) through the Minister of Justice;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 4 JSA obliges the heads of the magistracy to submit the personnel proposals of the general assemblies to the SJC through the Minister of Justice;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 8 JSA authorizes the Minister of Justice as chairman of the SJC to issue orders with which to appoint, reduce, transfer and dismiss absolutely all judges, prosecutors and investigators. (Until this legislative change, the powers of the Minister of Justice in this regard extended only to the level of appellate judges and did not cover the prosecution and the investigation.);

- § 9 in the part of art. 35a, para 1 JSA envisages the Minister of Justice to prepare a summary report on the activity of the bodies of the judiciary and to submit it for consideration in the SJC;

- § 9 in the part of art. 35a, para 2 JSA authorizes the Minister of Justice to submit annually to the National Assembly a summary report on the activity of the bodies of the judiciary;

- § 9 in the part of art. 35b enables the inspectorate at the Ministry of Justice to check the organization of the administrative activity of the courts, the prosecutor's offices and the investigative services, as well as the movement and the closing of their cases. The Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court, the Prosecutor General, the Supreme Cassation Prosecutor's Office and the Supreme Administrative Prosecutor's Office are no longer excluded from these inspections;

- § 9 in the part of art. 35d JSA stipulates that the management and storage of the personnel files of judges, prosecutors and investigators shall be carried out by the Minister of Justice;

- § 9 in the part of art. 35e JSA envisages not a law but an act of the Council of Ministers to regulate the organization of the forensic examinations and the activity of the forensic experts;

- with § 9 in the part of art. 35f, para 2, 6 and 7 JSA the National Institute of Justice is appointed to the Minister of Justice. The Minister is assigned to issue regulations for the activities of the institute and to allow specialized non-profit legal entities to improve the qualification of magistrates;

- § 14, item 2 in the part of art. 63, para 1, item 3, b. “B” JSA obliges the chairman of the district court to send references and statistical data to the Minister of Justice for consideration by the SJC;

- § 17, item 2 in the part of art. 79, para 1, item 2, b. "A" and "b" JSA provides for the annual reports on the activities of the appellate, district and regional courts, as well as the relevant reports and statistics to be sent to the Minister of Justice for consideration by the SJC;

- § 23, which in item 100, para 1 JSA creates item 6, obliges the Supreme Administrative Court to send to the Minister of Justice the annual report on its activity;

- § 27, which amends Article 114, paragraph 6 of the JSA, obliges the Prosecutor General to prepare an annual report on the activities of the prosecution and to send it to the Minister of Justice for inclusion in the annual report under Article 27, paragraph 1, item 10 JSA;

- § 69 of the Law on Judicial Education, which amends Art. ;

- § 85, which creates a new para 3 in art. 190 JSA, provides for the permits for leave of the managers under art. 125a JSA to be communicated to the Minister of Justice.

It should be borne in mind that Bulgaria is a state governed by the rule of law with a division of powers into legislative, executive and judicial - Article 8 of the Basic Law, in which the administration of justice is an independent state function. The Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria contains an independent Chapter Six, entitled "Judiciary", which constitutionally recognizes and legitimizes the "third power".

By the will of the constitutional legislator, the judiciary is the most independent and autonomous - Article 117, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law. The Supreme Supervision for accurate and uniform application of the laws by the courts is carried out only by the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court - Art. 124 and Art. 125, para 1 of the Constitution.

The three authorities must cooperate. The legislator is obliged to provide mechanisms for balancing the relations between them, and not to allow the executive power to interfere in the exercise of judicial functions.

It is no coincidence that, by the will of the constitutional legislator, the Minister of Justice is not the chairman, but only the chairman of the SJC sessions, and without the right to vote. (Almost until the last moment of adoption of Article 130, paragraph 5 of the Basic Law, the deputies of the Grand National Assembly had the attitude that the chairman of the SJC should be the President of the Republic as a greater guarantee for the independence of the judiciary.);

With Decision № 1/1999 on c.d. № 34/1998 The Constitutional Court recognized the right of the Minister of Justice, as chairman of the SJC, to make staff proposals to this body.

However, with the above-mentioned provisions of the Law on the Judiciary, the powers of the executive branch in relation to the judiciary are excessively increased, which violates Art. 8, Art. 117, para 2, Art. 124 and Art. law. It is particularly inadmissible from the point of view of the Constitution:

- Proposals of the judiciary, including the presidents of the Supreme Courts and the Prosecutor General, to be made to the SJC obligatorily, solely through the Minister of Justice, who is a representative of the central executive and an important political figure.

This creates conditions for the administration to interfere in the autonomous and independent personnel policy of the judiciary, carried out by its bodies. It is extremely unacceptable from the point of view of the Basic Law that even the highest magistrates cannot submit their proposals directly to the SJC, and this should be done through the mediation of the executive branch;

- the annual reports on the activity of the courts, prosecutor's offices and investigative services to be submitted for consideration to the SJC through the Minister of Justice, who will prepare a summary report on their activity. Courts, prosecutors' offices and investigative services cannot be deprived of the opportunity to submit their annual reports directly to the SJC;

- the Minister of Justice to keep the personnel files of judges, prosecutors and investigators. In view of the division of powers, the personnel files of the personnel of one authority may not be formed and maintained by a representative of another authority;

- the Minister of Justice to issue orders appointing and dismissing absolutely all magistrates, including the Supreme Court judges and prosecutors from the General Prosecutor's Office. This makes it an absolute personnel center of the judiciary. The constitutional principle of independence and autonomy of the judiciary is implemented not only through its constitutional proclamation, but also through appropriate guarantees for non-interference in its work, created by the relevant legal order - Decision № 8/94 under c.d. № 9 of 1994;

- the Minister of Justice to submit annually to the Parliament a report on the activity of the independent judiciary. The Constitution excludes the possibility of an independent judiciary accountable to the legislature. It is even more absurd for this to happen through the executive branch. To the extent that the National Assembly can hear information on the activities of the judiciary, the report on this should be submitted only by representatives of the judiciary;

- the Inspectorate of the Ministry of Justice to inspect the activities of the Supreme Court of Cassation, the Supreme Administrative Court and the Prosecutor General. This is because the Chief Prosecutor under the Constitution supervises the legality and methodological guidance of the activities of all prosecutors - Article 126, paragraph 2 of the Constitution, and the Supreme Courts supervise the accurate and uniform application of laws by the courts - Article 124. and Article 125, paragraph 1 of the Constitution. (The Constitutional Court remains in its opinion expressed in Decision № 1/1999 on Code of Criminal Procedure № 34/98 with regard to the powers of the Inspectorate relating to other bodies of the judiciary.)

- The National Institute of Justice, which provides training for junior judges and prosecutors, as well as the training of all current judges, prosecutors and investigators, should be under the auspices of the executive, not the judiciary. This institute helps the professional training of magistrates, which is why its natural place in view of the basic law is in the judiciary.

- the procedure and conditions for conducting the theoretical and practical examination for legal capacity of lawyers, some of which are submitted to the judiciary, to be determined by the Minister of Justice and not by the National Assembly - Art. 4, para 1, Art. .84, item 1 and art. 133 of the Constitution.

- The Council of Ministers to adopt regulations for the organization of forensic examinations and the activity of forensic experts. The organization of the expertises and the expert activity are inextricably linked with the administration of justice, therefore in view of Article 133 of the Constitution their activity should be regulated by law.

Therefore, the following should be declared unconstitutional:

- § 3 ZIDZSV, item 1, item “d” in the part of art. 27, para 1, item 10 JSA regarding the words “summarized by the Minister of Justice”;

- § 6 of the Judiciary Act in the part of Art. 30, para 1 of the Judicial Act regarding the words “through the Minister of Justice, who within 7 days sends them to the Supreme Judicial Council with an opinion”;

- § 9 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 35f, para 6 JSA regarding the words “the Minister of Justice, coordinated with”;

- § 9 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 35f, para 7 JSA regarding the words “The Minister of Justice in coordination with”;

- § 14, item 2 of the Law on Copyright and Related Rights in the part of art. 63, para 1, item 3, b. “B” JSA regarding the words “of the Minister of Justice”;

- § 17, item 2 of the Act in the part of art. 79, para. 1, item 2, items “a” and “b” of the JSA, regarding the words “of the Minister of Justice”;

- § 23 of the Law on the Judiciary, which in Article 100, paragraph 1 of the JSA is created item 6, regarding the words “of the Minister of Justice”;

- § 27 of the Law on the Judiciary, which amends Article 114, paragraph 6 of the JSA, regarding the words “of the Minister of Justice”;

- § 69 ZIDZSV, which amends Art. 163 JSA, in the part regarding the words “under conditions and by order, determined by an ordinance of the Minister of Justice” and

- § 85 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which creates a new para 3 in Art.

II. Regarding the personnel powers of the general meetings 

A number of the provisions of the Judiciary Act authorize the general meetings of judges, prosecutors and investigators with important functions in staffing the judiciary. It's about:

- § 4, item 1, which amends art. 28, para 1 JSA. According to this provision, proposals for appointment as chairman of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court may be made by the respective plenums of the two courts, for general prosecutor - the general meetings of the Supreme Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Prosecutor's Office, and for director of the National Investigation Service - the general meeting of investigators. from this service;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 1, b. “B” JSA, according to which a proposal for appointment of the chairmen of the military and appellate courts is made by the general assembly of the respective court;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 3, b. “B” JSA, according to which proposals for appointment of the heads of the regional, district, military and appellate prosecutors are made by the general meetings of the respective prosecutor's offices;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 7, b. “B” JSA, according to which the proposals for appointment of the chairmen of the district courts are made by the general assemblies of these courts;

§ 6 in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 9, item “a” JSA, according to which the proposals for appointment of the chairmen of the district courts are made on the basis of the general assembly of the district court;

- § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 10, item “b” JSA, according to which a proposal for appointment of the directors of the district investigation services is made by the general meetings of the investigators from the district investigation services.

In the same sense are § 6 in the part of art. 30, para 2, 3, 4 and 5 JSA; § 12 in the part of art. 56a, para 1 JSA and art. 56a, para 2, item 1 JSA; § 13, which amends and supplements Article 59 of the JSA; § 15, which amends Article 69, paragraph 2 of the JSA; § 16, which amends and supplements Article 76 of the JSA.

It should be borne in mind that by the will of the Grand National Assembly, reflected in the reasons for the adoption of the Constitution, the implementation of personnel policy in the judiciary is entrusted to a constitutionally established special body - the Supreme Judicial Council (Article 129 of the Basic Law).

General meetings of judges, prosecutors and investigators are not constitutionally provided bodies of the judiciary. They can be created, as far as it is necessary for the unification of the practice of application of the laws, raising the qualification of the magistrates, etc. However, they cannot become human resources of the judiciary, which can have a generally destabilizing effect on the activity of the judiciary. (In this sense, the opinion of the Union of Judges in Bulgaria is very definite.)

The constitutional function of judges is not to decide personnel issues, but to protect the rights and legitimate interests of citizens, legal entities and the state, and to administer justice in the name of the people - Article 117, paragraph 1 and Article 118 of the Constitution; of the prosecutors - to monitor the observance of the law - art. 127 of the Basic Law, and of the investigators - to carry out the preliminary proceedings in the criminal cases - art. 128 of the Constitution.

In addition, from the point of view of the Constitution, it is inadmissible for the general assembly of the district court to include bailiffs and registry judges, because they are not magistrates.

Therefore, as contrary to Art. 4, para 1 and Art. 129, para 1 of the Basic Law, the following should be declared unconstitutional:

- § 4, item 1 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which amends Article 28, paragraph 1 of the JSA;

- § 6 of the Law on Judicial Service in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 1, b “b” of the JSA regarding the words “on the basis of a proposal of the general meeting of the respective court”;

- § 6 ZIDZSV the part of art. 30, para 1, item 3, b. “B” JSA regarding the words “upon proposal of the general meetings of the prosecutors by the respective prosecutor's offices”;

- § 6 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 7, b. “B” JSA regarding the words “upon proposal of the general meeting of the respective court”;

- § 6 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 30, para 1, item 9, b. “A” JSA regarding the words “based on a proposal of the general assembly of the district court”;

- § 6 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, in the part of Art.

- § 6 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the part of Art.

- § 6 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the part of Art.

- § 6 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in the part of Art.

- § 6 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 30, para. 5 JSA regarding the words “of the general meetings and”;

- § 12 of the Law on Judicial Enforcement Agents in the part of Art. 56a, para 1 of the Judicial Service Act regarding the words “bailiffs and entry judges”;

- § 12 in the part of art. 56a, para 2 item 1 JSA;

- § 13 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which amends and supplements Article 59 of the Law on Judicial Service;

- § 15 of the Act on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which amends Article 69, paragraph 2 of the JSA;

- § 16 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

III. On the immunity and irremovability of magistrates 

With § 3, item 1, item “b” of the Law on the Judicial Service of the Republic of Bulgaria, Article 27, paragraph 1, item 6 of the JSA shall be supplemented, giving the opportunity and at the request of not less than one fifth of the members to waive the immunity of magistrates. In the same sense are § 45, item 1 of the Act, which amends Article 134, paragraph 3 of the JSA and § 45, item 2 of the Act, which establishes paragraph 4 in Article 134 of the JSA.

The Constitutional Court held that the provisions in question contradicted Article 127, item 1 of the Basic Law, according to which only the prosecution has accusatory functions for bringing to justice the persons who have committed a crime. The specified minimum quota of members of the SJC has no constitutional powers to initiate or initiate criminal prosecution, as well as to collect, verify and evaluate data in accordance with the requirements of the Code of Criminal Procedure. In this sense is also Decision № 1/1999 under c.d. № 34/1998 and Decision № 2/1992 on c.d. № 2/92

§ 35 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities amends Art. 125 JSA, and Art. 125a in the JSA, introducing a distinction between the existing positions in the bodies of the judiciary of magistrates and administrative heads. A mandate is introduced for the latter.

According to Article 129, paragraph 3 of the Constitution, judges, prosecutors and investigators become irremovable after completing three years of service in the position they hold. It is unlikely that the constitutional legislator would have used the term "position" if it did not take into account the specific official position of a judge, prosecutor or investigator in the hierarchy of the judiciary.

The Basic Law does not make any division of magistrates into "ordinary" and "managerial". All judges, prosecutors and investigators have a common status with regard to irremovability, which ensures the stability of the judiciary. This constitutional principle precludes the introduction of a mandate for a certain category of magistrates, which would lead to the replacement of judges, prosecutors and investigators from the position they hold (this is practically the case with the above-mentioned provisions). The Constitution allows an exception only in respect of the chairmen of the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court and the Prosecutor General - Article 129, paragraph 2 of the Basic Law.

It should also be borne in mind that magistrates may not be dismissed directly by the legislator by his act, but only by the body authorized by the Constitution - the SJC, in accordance with the grounds and procedure specified by law. In this sense is also Decision № 9/1994 under c.d. № 11/94

The independence of the judiciary is also guaranteed by the fact that the magistrates are irremovable - Decision № 6/1993 under c.d. № 4/93. Irremovability makes them independent of other state bodies in the exercise of their powers. In determining by virtue of Article 133 of the Constitution the conditions and procedure for appointment and dismissal of judges, prosecutors and investigators, the legislator is obliged to comply with the constitutionally established guarantee of independence, such as the irremovability referred to in Article 129, para 2 of the basic law. In this sense is also Decision № 8/94 under c.d. № 9/94

Therefore, § 35 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and § 36 of the Act

§ 40 of the Law on Judicial Service, which amends Article 129, paragraph 1 of the Judicial Act, provides that judges, prosecutors and investigators initially appointed to the judiciary shall become irremovable after reaching three years of service in the respective position.

According to Article 129, paragraph 3 of the Constitution, judges, prosecutors and investigators become irremovable after completing three years of service in the position they hold, regardless of whether they were initially appointed in the judiciary. That is why the norm of § 40 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which amends Article 129, paragraph 1 of the JSA, should be declared unconstitutional in the part concerning the word “initially”.

§ 43 of the JSAA creates a new Article 131a of the JSA, according to which a permanent judge, prosecutor or investigator may be demoted if he “no longer possesses the necessary qualities to perform his / her professional duties”.

In this case, the basis for disciplinary punishment is a general qualification and assessment, which is made on the basis of the overall work of the respective magistrate. The Constitutional Court with Decision № 1/1999 under c.d. № 34/1998 expressly stated that disciplinary offenses, like crimes and administrative offenses, must have clearly and precisely defined factual elements. Otherwise, disciplinary liability of the magistrates may result in any revocation of a decision on its appeal due to incorrect application of substantive law or for a procedural violation committed during the examination of the case.

Therefore, due to a contradiction with Art. 4, para 1 of the Basic Law, § 43 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities should be declared unconstitutional.

IV. On the ranks of the judiciary

With § 54 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and § 55 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, Art. These provisions introduce an entirely new system of ranks in the judiciary depending on the length of service as a judge, prosecutor or investigator.

When the new system of ranks is put into effect, the already acquired rights of the magistrates for their promotion to a rank on the basis of proven good work are affected, which violates Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Constitution. The status already acquired under the previous legislation is not taken into account, which results in the revocation by law of legal rights already acquired by the magistrates, and ultimately to their actual reduction on the spot. For example, if before the new system of ranks introduced by the amendments to the Law on Judicial Service in question, a judge in the Court of Appeal with 11 years of experience had the opportunity to acquire the rank of chairman of a division in the Supreme Court of Cassation, under the new legislation he could not get it.

The above provisions should therefore be declared unconstitutional.

V. Regarding the activity of the Supreme Judicial Council

Some norms of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities give powers to the SJC, which do not comply with the Basic Law. Thus:

- with § 1, item 2 of the Law on Judicial Service, which amends Art. 20, para 3 of the Judicial Act, a member of the SJC, whose election is disputed, is given the opportunity to participate in the meetings, but without the right to vote.

- с § 3, т.1, б. "A", which amends Article 27, paragraph 1, item 3 of the JSA, provides for the SJC to determine the number of bailiffs, registry judges and court employees. In this sense is also § 6 ZIDZSV in the part of art. 30, para 1 JSA;

- § 3, v.1, b. “D” in the part, which creates a new item 14 in art. 27, para 1 JSA, envisages the SJC to approve rules for professional ethics, adopted by the respective professional organizations of the court employees.

According to Article 129, paragraph 1 of the Basic Law, the SJC has personnel powers only in respect of judges, prosecutors and investigators, and not in respect of bailiffs, registry judges and court employees.

It is unacceptable in view of the principles of the rule of law of a member of the SJC whose election is contested to participate in its meetings and form a quorum, while not having the right to vote. Thus, the powers under the already established and exercising mandate of the SJC are unconstitutionally limited.

In view of the above, the following should be declared unconstitutional:

- § 1, item 2 of the JSAA, which amends Article 20, paragraph 3 of the JSA;

- § 3, item 1, item “a” of the Law on Judicial Enforcement Agents, which amends Art. 27, para 1, item 3 regarding the words “bailiffs, entry judges and court employees”;

- § 3, v.1, b. “D” of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which creates a new item 14 in Article 129, paragraph 1 of the JSA;

- § 6, in the part of art. 30, para 1 JSA, regarding the words “the bailiff, the entry judges and the court employees”.

VI. Regarding other disputed provisions of the Act

In conclusion, the Constitutional Court held that the rest of the impugned provisions were not unconstitutional and that the claim should therefore be rejected.

There are no constitutional obstacles for the SJC to approve rules for professional ethics, adopted by the respective professional organizations of judges, prosecutors and investigators - § 3, item 1, b. “D” of the Judiciary Act in the part by which a new item 13 is created in Art. 27, para 1 of the Judicial System Act This is because judges, prosecutors and investigators are appointed, promoted, demoted, transferred and dismissed - art. 129, para 1 of the Constitution. The rules for professional ethics, in turn, are criteria for the appointment of judges, prosecutors and investigators, and their violation leads to their disciplinary liability - § 37, item 2 of the Law on Judicial Practices, which creates a new paragraph 2 in Article 126 of the Judicial Act and § 74 ZIDZSV, which amends Art. 168, para 1, item 3 JSA.

The same applies to § 40 in the part of Article 129, paragraph 4 of the JSA, which assigns the SJC with an ordinance to determine the procedure for attestation of magistrates.

That is why the above-mentioned provisions of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities are not unconstitutional.

There are no constitutional obstacles in the JSA to include the chapter "Minister of Justice". This is because according to Article 130, paragraph 5 of the Basic Law, the sessions of the SJC are chaired by the Minister of Justice.

There are no grounds for declaring the unconstitutionality of § 6 of the JSAA in the part of Art. 30, para 6 of the JSA. The right of the Minister of Justice to make proposals to the SJC for appointment, promotion, demotion, transfer and dismissal of magistrates was recognized by the Constitutional Court with Decision № 1/1999 under Code of Civil Procedure. № 34/1998 The considerations set out in this decision that there are no violations of the constitutional principle of separation of powers are still relevant today. This also applies to the possibility recognized by the provision in question of the Minister of Justice to give opinions on the proposals to the SJC. Therefore, there are no grounds for a change in the practice of the Constitutional Court.

It is not in violation of the Constitution and the possibility for the Minister of Justice to annually submit to the National Assembly a report on the state, structure and dynamics of crime, the causes and conditions that determine them, as well as the measures taken - § 3 of the Act. 35a, para 3 JSA. It should be borne in mind that the Minister of Justice is a member of the government responsible for the domestic policy of the country - Article 105, paragraph 1 of the Basic Law. Part of this policy is the fight against crime.

The provisions of Chapter Three of the Law on the Judiciary relating to: the activities of the National Institute of Justice (other than those indicated as unconstitutional in Chapter One of this Decision) are not in violation of the Constitution; The unified information system for combating crime; security of court buildings, etc.

There is no constitutional prohibition for the SJC to adopt internal regulations for its activity and for its administration - § 3, item 1, item “d” of the Law on the Judiciary, which in Article 27, paragraph 1 of the JSA creates a new item 11. This is thus, because the organization of the SJC itself is regulated by Chapter Two of the JSA, which complies with the requirement of Article 133 of the Constitution.

It is not unconstitutional and § 8 of the JSA, which amends Article 34, paragraph 1 of the JSA. It is obvious that the interested persons can appeal against decisions of the SJC to the Supreme Administrative Court only when they have the character of individual administrative acts, taking into account the Interpretative Decision № 2/2002 under c.d. № 2 of 2002

There is no constitutional obstacle to the establishment by law of the position of judicial assistant in the Supreme Court of Cassation and the Supreme Administrative Court. These are qualified lawyers to assist judges in their actual judicial activity. That is why § 59 of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which creates a new Article 148a of the JSA, is not unconstitutional.

VII. On the unconstitutionality of the whole law

The declaring unconstitutional part of the provisions of the Law on the Protection of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is not of the nature of unconstitutionality of the entire law, therefore this request should be rejected.

In view of all the above and on the grounds of Article 149, paragraph 1, item 2 of the Constitution, the Constitutional Court
