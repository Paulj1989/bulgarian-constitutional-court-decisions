Special opinion of Judge Vasil Gotsev

I signed the decision with a dissenting opinion for the following reasons:

І. Concerning a violation under Article 19, paragraph 2 of the Constitution

Article 1, paragraph 1 of the RTA stipulates that the law regulates radio and television activity. Paragraph 2 stipulates that radio and television activity is the creation of radio and television programs and additional information through appropriate distribution, which are intended for immediate reception by an unlimited number of persons. It follows that the RTA regulates the creation, production of radio and television programs intended for distribution, and not their distribution itself. The distribution regime is subject to the Telecommunications Act. Article 1 of it states that it "regulates the public relations related to the implementation of telecommunications in the Republic of Bulgaria". The conclusion is that when considering the regulations established by the Act, we must keep in mind that this refers to the process of creating, producing programs, and not to their dissemination.

Until the amendment of the Radio and Television Act (SG, issue 96 of 2001) there was a uniform regime for all producers of programs - licensing. The amendment of the law creates a dual regime in view of the way in which the program is distributed. Pursuant to § 25 of the LRA, Art. 105, para 1 of the LRA stipulates that radio and television activity through the use of available and / or construction, maintenance and use of new telecommunication networks for terrestrial radio broadcasting is carried out on the basis of a license. Registration is sufficient for non-terrestrial distribution.

The opinion of the National Assembly in the present case maintains that those who want something from the state and those who do not engage in anything should not be subjected to the same regime. Excerpts from Decision № 7/1996 of the Constitutional Court (SG, issue 55 of 96) are indicated, in which a recommendation is given for mitigation of the licensing regime in the indicated cases and the transition to registration. It should be noted, however, that the decision and the cited passages do not refer to the substantive part, to the creation of a program, but to its transmission, its distribution - the telecommunications part. The decision is in relation to "access to the air", not in connection with the creation of a program. Paragraph 46 of the LULUCF, which creates the new Article 125a of the RTA, establishes a registration regime for persons wishing to create programs for distribution by non-terrestrial technical means, and does not regulate the transfer of programs. The creation of a program is not related to how it will be transferred.

A dual program design regime first establishes an unequal position of some businesses compared to others. In addition, inequalities are created with regard to the consumers of the respective programs. With the issuance of the license, which will set certain rules that are not required to comply with producers of programs that are only registered, consumers will be provided with a different product depending on whether the creator of the program is licensed or only registered .

The difference also creates different working conditions for the entities that produce programs. Privileges are established for some and at the same time more severe treatment of others. All this violates Article 19, paragraph 2 of the Constitution. The creation of a radio and television program is generally done under the same conditions, regardless of how it will be transmitted - terrestrial or non-terrestrial. The different regime introduced by the Law on Public Health Insurance puts producers under different legal conditions. The way in which the program will be transmitted does not give any grounds for this. Once produced, the program can be transmitted in one way or another, depending on who the manufacturer will distribute it to.

The inequalities created by the LULUCF in view of the different treatment of the created programs with license and through registration are significant:

- according to art. 109, para 1 of the RTA the licenses are issued for a period of 15 years, while according to art. 125, para 7 the registrations are indefinite;

- in case of revocation or termination of a license for a program on some grounds the respective telecommunication license is also terminated (art. 121, art. 123a RTA), while from deletion of the registration due to systematic violations of the law (art. 126a, para 4 RTA) no revocation of the relevant telecommunications license;

- different are the financial penalties for violation of licensing and registration regime. Of course, the legislator has the right to determine one or another sanction, but in this case different sanctions are determined for the same activity - creating programs;

- licensed operators have national, regional or local coverage. This follows from Article 110, paragraph 1, item 5 of the RTA. Such restrictions are not set for the registered operators (Art. 125a, para 4, sentence 2 of the RTA). In this way they gain national reach;

- the difference in the term and scope of action of the licensed and registered operators puts them at a disadvantage and in the implementation of their economic activity - planned investments, etc .;

- the licensing of radio and television operators also affects national security issues. Putting some operators out of control from this point of view not only creates inequality, but also affects national security. The registration regime makes it impossible to set specific conditions in its defense, which is sometimes necessary and does not allow for control and sanctions. For example, the license may stipulate that in certain circumstances the program will have to meet certain national security needs. This cannot be done during registration. Given that the range of transmitters by satellite and cable is particularly wide, there is no reason to exclude them from national security protection rules, as allowed by the licensing regime;

- Art. 19, para 2 of the Constitution, creating and guaranteeing to all citizens equal conditions for economic activity, also protects the consumer. It follows from the text that consumer protection must be the same. The creation of a different regime for different program producers, in which some of them are obliged to comply with certain rules established by the license and others not, establishes inequality of the audience regarding the product served to it. In the case of a license, it will comply with the rules it sets, and in the registration regime everything will be left to the discretion of the manufacturer. The uniform regulation of the programs in terms of content, no matter how they are transmitted, guarantees the equal protection that the Constitution gives to the consumer.

The regulation of the programs should not be made dependent on the way in which they reach the viewer. This is because in any way - terrestrial or non-terrestrial, the program is equally accepted by him. With the revocation of the licenses for some programs, the possibility for explicit recording of a number of specific obligations of the registered operators, which the licensed operators will have, disappears. Registered operators, for example, will not be required to observe a certain technical quality in the production of the programs, which would be a condition for granting the license;

- the amendments to the law introduce the so-called tied licensing of radio and television operators for programs, on the one hand, and of the same persons as telecommunications operators for terrestrial broadcasting of programs via radio frequency spectrum, on the other hand. Upon receipt, revocation, termination or transfer of the program license, the same is automatically done under the license under the Telecommunications Act for distribution of the respective program through spectrum. Until the amendment, the RTA provided for separate licensing of content and separate licensing of distribution. Not every operator makes a program. There may be businesses that only distribute but not produce programs. With the licensing of terrestrial distributors bound by the amendment of the law, this possibility is taken away, and this puts in an unequal position those economic entities that simultaneously produce and distribute programs by the entities that do not want to produce programs, but only to distribute them. . Bound licensing works in the analog industry, but is not applicable to digital, through which a distributor can serve a number of programs. This creates inequalities between the analogue and digital industries. The licensing regime provided for in § 34 of the LRA, amending Article 116 of the LRA and the procedure under Art. 116a, 116b, 116c, 116d of the LRA, established by § 35, 36, 37 and 38 of the LRA, for licensing a program and distribution is not applicable to applicants for digital television and radio, as one broadcaster has the technical capability to broadcast more than one program. If a program producer who is under the licensing regime is also a distribution licensee, he may be deprived of the opportunity to broadcast his programs through it by other program producers who have only registered them, but who use the digital distributor of that program, who has obtained a license for both program and distribution. If the licensee's license is revoked, then other software vendors that have used the digital distributor will automatically lose the opportunity to operate.

ІІ. Regarding violations under Art. 18, para 3 and 5 of the Constitution

In Decision № 33/1998 (SG, issue 147 of 1998) the Constitutional Court stated that the sovereign rights on the radio frequency spectrum are exercised only by the state and only it can issue permits for carrying out activities through the radio frequency spectrum, as well as it cannot cede these rights to a non-state body because it is a violation of the Constitution. In the presence of Art. 18, para 3 of the Constitution, the provision of the spectrum and the geostationary orbit for use cannot but be carried out only by a state body. The same decision states that the state, through a state body designated by law, licenses any activity carried out using the radio frequency spectrum. The Constitutional Court has had cases to take a firm view that the radio and television regulatory body is not a state body. The Council for Electronic Media, established with the amendments to the Law on Radio and Television, is constituted in the same way as the previous NRTC. Therefore, what has been expressed by the Constitutional Court so far with regard to the NRTC has full force for the CEM as well. Both in Decision № 21/1996 (SG, issue 102 of 1996) and in Decision № 10/1999 (SG, issue 60 of 1999) the Constitutional Court ruled that the regulatory body for radio and television, the then NRTC was a non-governmental body. Decision № 21/1996 states that the NRTC can only issue an opinion on permits. It is noted that "according to Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Constitution, the state exercises sovereign rights over the radio frequency spectrum and its indisputable right and obligation to allocate available frequencies includes its right to receive advisory opinions from whomever it deems appropriate." It is further clarified that the provisions (Article 15, item 2 of the RTA) neither oblige nor restrict the competent state body to grant the requested concession. There is no reason for the Constitutional Court to deviate from its opinion expressed so far and to accept that the CEM, as a non-state body, will be able to license activity carried out via radio frequency spectrum. The adoption of the permit, which gives ZIDZRT, means a sharp turn in the practice of the Constitutional Court - creating a contradictory practice. This is true, although according to § 13 of the LRA, after the amendment of Art. 32, para 1 and the created new item 13 of the RTA, CRC provides preliminary information to the CEM regarding the technical parameters necessary for terrestrial radio broadcasting of radio and television programs for the indicated from the CEM settlement, region or for the whole territory of the Republic of Bulgaria, including free radio frequencies, permissible transmission capacities, as well as other necessary technical information. The license subsequently granted by CRC does not change things. The remaining power of CRC is only formal, because CRC has no other option but to grant the license to the person for whom the CEM has decided. In this way the constitutionally established by Article 18, paragraph 3 of the Constitution right and obligation of the state to exercise directly sovereign rights over the radio frequency spectrum is circumvented. In fact, these rights pass with the new legislation to a non-governmental body, such as the CEM, and CRC only formally implements its decision.  

According to the above arguments, I consider that they contradict Article 19, paragraph 2 and Article 18, paragraphs 3 and 5 of the Constitution: § 1, § 6 (regarding Article 20, paragraph 1 of the RTA), § 13 (without art. 32, para. 1, item 12 of the RTA), § 23 (regarding art. 102, para. 1, item 2 of the RTA), § 25, § 26 (regarding art. 106, para. 3 of the RTA) ), §§ 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, § 42 (regarding the created new para 2 of art. 121 RTA), § 43, § 44, § 45 (regarding the amendment of art. 125, para 2 and 3 ZRT), § 46, § 48 and § 53 of ZIDZRT.
