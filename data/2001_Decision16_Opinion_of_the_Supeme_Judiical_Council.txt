AGU DEAR LADIES AND GENERAL CONSTITUTIONAL JUDGES,

With a ruling of March 15, 2001 under cd. 6/2001 The Supreme
a Judicial Council is constituted as an interested party in the case,
formed at the request of a group of MPs for announcement
the unconstitutionality of provisions of the State Budget Law for 2001.

The opinion of the Supreme Judicial Council, on the merits of
the case concerning the budget of the judiciary is as follows:

1. We support the considerations set out in the request for
unconstitutionality of art. 2, para. 1 of the State Budget Law for 2001.

Several decisions of the Constitutional Court related to the interpretation of Art. 117,
al. 3 of the CRB and especially Decision Xe 17 under c.d. He 13/1995 categorically
declare that the state budget, which does not provide funds for
the state institutions established in the CRB, including the bodies
of the judiciary is unconstitutional. In this case
is unconstitutional the refusal of the National Assembly to include in Art. 2, para. on
independent order, both the budget of the SJC and the budget of the SCC,
The SAC, the Prosecutor's Office, the courts and the investigation services. That's right
prepared the budget for the period from 1992 to 1998, inclusive, after
the entry into force of the ERO.

The SJC expressed the same clear opinion in the proposed
the attention of MPs draft budget of

the judiciary for 2001, in which it explicitly provided
distribution of the budget by bodies of the judiciary.

2. The unconstitutionality of the provision of art. 2, para.
2 of the State Budget Law for 2001 is substantiated in the request with its contradiction with
Art. 8 and Art. 117, para. 2 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. The independence of
the budget of the judiciary, as a characteristic of its
independence, ”according to the applicants, excludes 9 interference from
/ the executive power in its compilation and implementation.
The grant of a subsidy of 9090 of the amount set,
according to the cited provision, it turns it into a subvention in the rest
part, the estimated costs being reduced by 1020, although
the judiciary must have the means to cover its costs
1009 to ensure its normal operation. This creates a danger
to provide the necessary budgetary resources to cover
the budget expenditures approved by the National Assembly under the budget of
the judiciary and it is made dependent on the executive, which
is responsible for the implementation of the state budget. Thus,
that provision should be considered unconstitutional,
because it creates an opportunity for the executive to intervene in
the implementation of the budget of the judiciary and difficulties in
carrying out the activity of the latter. It should be similar
the authorization and the unconstitutionality of the provision
of Art. 13, para. 5 of the Law in view of the reference to art. 2, para. 2.

3. According to the applicants, the seizure of income within the meaning of
Art. 2, para. 5 of the LSA RB for 2001 is inadmissible interference of
the executive in the independent budget of the independent
judiciary. This provision is not unconstitutional. After
as the judiciary cannot enforce the proceeds of the collection of
fees, imperatively determined in the State Budget of the Republic of Bulgaria for 2001, the difference may
shall be covered at the expense of the Republican budget. In case of overfulfillment
of fee income, the funds must still go to
The republican budget, as the expenditure part of the budget of
the judiciary is defined and only through it can it be decided
the question of both the surplus and the lack of funds of its common
volume fixed in the budget of the judiciary, adopted by the People's
meeting. Determining this amount as a law of the People's

assembly and not by the executive, therefore, does not contradict
of the methodology of drawing up and implementing the budget of the judiciary
power.

4. According to the request the provision of art. 2, para. 8 of the Law on the Republic of Bulgaria
for 2001, which provides that the judiciary,
accommodated in buildings owned by the state and municipalities do not pay
rents for their use, contradicts the principles of Art. 4, para. You
Art. 140 of the Constitution of the Republic of Bulgaria. > The provision is not
unconstitutional. The regime of the objects of state and
municipal property according to art. 17, para. 4 of the CRB under constitutional
delegation is determined by law. ZDS and ZOB6S, issued on the grounds
this delegation provides for free provision
of legal entities on budget support of objects of this
property in connection with meeting public needs
of national and municipal importance. According to Art. 2, para 2, item 2 and art. 15,
al.al. Giz from ZDS, these are the properties of public state property,
provided to the agencies for the performance of their functions for
gratuitous management, which according to art. 16, para. 1 cannot
be rented out. This principle according to Art. 17 of the LSA covers
and the private property of the State in respect of the legal persons of
budget support, such as the judiciary.
The situation is similar with the properties, public municipal
property, according to art. 3, para. 2 and Art. 12, para. 2 of 3O6C. The last one
text provides for their gratuitous provision to legal entities
of budgetary support, thus satisfying
public needs of municipal importance. > Hired
legal relations are remunerative, which means that the provision of
buildings, state and municipal property of the judiciary
power without paying rent, ie is gratuitous, is not
